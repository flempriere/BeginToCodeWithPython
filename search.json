The same happens for an incomplete expression. e.g. the following is a shell sequence,\n\n2+\n\n\n  Cell In[32], line 1\n    2+\n      ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate 2+3*4?\n\nWe would expect 14 from the basic mathematical order of operations. Plugging this into the shell,\n\n2 + 3 * 4\n\n14\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3)*4?\n\nWe would expect 20 from the basic mathematical order of operations. Plugging this into the shell,\n\n(2 + 3) * 4\n\n20\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3*4?\n\nWe might expect a syntax error, instead the interpreter, simply goes to a new line, and waits for us to enter the matching parenthesis. One such sequence in the shell might be,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n)\n\n14\n\n\nThese notes use a slightly different version of a python interpreter called a Jupyter Notebook to render the inline code. In Jupyter Notebooks code is written in cells and executed cell-by cell. This means that the interpreter can’t wait for the user to provide the missing input, so instead we get the slightly different error message below,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n\n\n  Cell In[36], line 1\n    (2 + 3 * 4\n              ^\nSyntaxError: incomplete input\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate )2+3*4?\n\nIf we see a right parenthesis before a left parenthesis there is no way to retroactively go back and fix the missing left, like in the previous case where the shell simply waited for us to add the parenthesis. So here we would expect a syntax error.\n\n)2+3*4\n\n\n  Cell In[37], line 1\n    )2+3*4\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unmatched ')'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the interpreter like this to work line by line because python is a “scripting” language\n\ni.e. The program reads a line and then interprets the output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot all languages are scripting languages\nNot all languages are scripting languages. Some are converted to low-level hardware instructions. This is called compilation, and in place of an interpreter it requires a compiler to convert the code. Compiled programs are typically faster, since they can be optimised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers fundamentally represent data as \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in binary\n\nWe build up layers of abstract that let us handle concepts like numbers, characters and strings of text\n\nData can be regarded as the stored values representing information\nInformation is thus the interpretation of data, to mean something\n\n\n\n\nPython scripts thus can be considered data processors\n\nThe script is interpreted and converted to output\n\n\n\n\nStart up the python interpreter and run the following\n\n'hello'\n\n 'hello'\n\n'hello'\n\n\n\nLike before with \\(2\\) the word is echoed.\n\n`‘hello’ + ’ world’\n\n 'hello' + 'world'\n\n'helloworld'\n\n\n\n“Adding” two words performs a string concatenation\nObserve we explicitly have to include the space character in one of the strings\nA cool observation is that + changes it’s behaviour in response to what it’s arguments are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if missed the closing quote of a string you were typing?\n\nWe would expect it, to either hang waiting for the closing quote like with the missing left parenthesis, or a syntax error like a right quote. We find,\n\n\n'hello\n\n\n  Cell In[40], line 1\n    'hello\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEOL stands for “End of Line”\nOperands like strings and numbers can’t span multiple lines\nA string literal is just a string there in the code\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to subtract one string from another?\n\nWhile addition of strings can be easily seen as concatenation, there is no meaningful equivalent for substraction.\nWe could think of it as substring removal, but that has a lot of nuance that is hard to capture in a single symbol. We expect an error.\n\n\n 'hello' - ' world'\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[41], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' - ' world'\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\n\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: ‘str’ and ‘str’\nThe error message is somewhat obtuse but simply means that for the operand (-) we can’t subtract a string from another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to add a number to a string?\n\nThis one can vary. There a two valid interpretations,\n\nYou can’t add a number to a word\nTreat the number as word, and concatenate it\n\nMost languages, use the former choice and so we make the assumption that python does too\n\n\n 'hello' + 2\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[42], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' + 2\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n\n\n\n\nThe result is as expected, the error tells we can only concatenate a string to another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to multiply a string by a number?\n\nAgain there are two interpretations,\n\nYou can’t multiply a word by a number\nYou can consider word * 3 as adding word three lots of word, where adding is string concatenation\n\nLets see what choice python uses,\n\n\n 'hello' * 3\n\n'hellohellohello'\n\n\n\nThe moral?

The same happens for an incomplete expression. e.g. the following is a shell sequence,\n\n2+\n\n\n  Cell In[32], line 1\n    2+\n      ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate 2+3*4?\n\nWe would expect 14 from the basic mathematical order of operations. Plugging this into the shell,\n\n2 + 3 * 4\n\n14\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3)*4?\n\nWe would expect 20 from the basic mathematical order of operations. Plugging this into the shell,\n\n(2 + 3) * 4\n\n20\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3*4?\n\nWe might expect a syntax error, instead the interpreter, simply goes to a new line, and waits for us to enter the matching parenthesis. One such sequence in the shell might be,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n)\n\n14\n\n\nThese notes use a slightly different version of a python interpreter called a Jupyter Notebook to render the inline code. In Jupyter Notebooks code is written in cells and executed cell-by cell. This means that the interpreter can’t wait for the user to provide the missing input, so instead we get the slightly different error message below,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n\n\n  Cell In[36], line 1\n    (2 + 3 * 4\n              ^\nSyntaxError: incomplete input\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate )2+3*4?\n\nIf we see a right parenthesis before a left parenthesis there is no way to retroactively go back and fix the missing left, like in the previous case where the shell simply waited for us to add the parenthesis. So here we would expect a syntax error.\n\n)2+3*4\n\n\n  Cell In[37], line 1\n    )2+3*4\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unmatched ')'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the interpreter like this to work line by line because python is a “scripting” language\n\ni.e. The program reads a line and then interprets the output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot all languages are scripting languages\nNot all languages are scripting languages. Some are converted to low-level hardware instructions. This is called compilation, and in place of an interpreter it requires a compiler to convert the code. Compiled programs are typically faster, since they can be optimised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers fundamentally represent data as \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in binary\n\nWe build up layers of abstract that let us handle concepts like numbers, characters and strings of text\n\nData can be regarded as the stored values representing information\nInformation is thus the interpretation of data, to mean something\n\n\n\n\nPython scripts thus can be considered data processors\n\nThe script is interpreted and converted to output\n\n\n\n\nStart up the python interpreter and run the following\n\n'hello'\n\n 'hello'\n\n'hello'\n\n\n\nLike before with \\(2\\) the word is echoed.\n\n`‘hello’ + ’ world’\n\n 'hello' + 'world'\n\n'helloworld'\n\n\n\n“Adding” two words performs a string concatenation\nObserve we explicitly have to include the space character in one of the strings\nA cool observation is that + changes it’s behaviour in response to what it’s arguments are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if missed the closing quote of a string you were typing?\n\nWe would expect it, to either hang waiting for the closing quote like with the missing left parenthesis, or a syntax error like a right quote. We find,\n\n\n'hello\n\n\n  Cell In[40], line 1\n    'hello\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEOL stands for “End of Line”\nOperands like strings and numbers can’t span multiple lines\nA string literal is just a string there in the code\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to subtract one string from another?\n\nWhile addition of strings can be easily seen as concatenation, there is no meaningful equivalent for substraction.\nWe could think of it as substring removal, but that has a lot of nuance that is hard to capture in a single symbol. We expect an error.\n\n\n 'hello' - ' world'\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[41], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' - ' world'\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\n\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: ‘str’ and ‘str’\nThe error message is somewhat obtuse but simply means that for the operand (-) we can’t subtract a string from another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to add a number to a string?\n\nThis one can vary. There a two valid interpretations,\n\nYou can’t add a number to a word\nTreat the number as word, and concatenate it\n\nMost languages, use the former choice and so we make the assumption that python does too\n\n\n 'hello' + 2\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[42], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' + 2\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n\n\n\n\nThe result is as expected, the error tells we can only concatenate a string to another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to multiply a string by a number?\n\nAgain there are two interpretations,\n\nYou can’t multiply a word by a number\nYou can consider word * 3 as adding word three lots of word, where adding is string concatenation\n\nLets see what choice python uses,\n\n\n 'hello' * 3\n\n'hellohellohello'\n\n\n\nThe moral?

If we want a computer to reject negative ages, we must actually build that understanding into the program\n\nIf the output from a program is settings for the fuel-injection system on a car, is the output data or information?\n\nAs soon as something starts acting on data, it becomes information. A human being is not doing anything with these values, but they will cause the speed of the engine to change, which might affect humans, so this makes the output information rather than data by the authors opinion\n\nIs the computer stupid because it can’t understand English?\n\nNo, english can be a quite ambiguous languge. The legal profession is an example of somewhere were debate over the semantics of language is tricky\n\nIf I don’t know how to solve a problem, can I write a program to do it?\n\nNo, you need to understand the solution before you can write it and make sure that it does exactly what you want it to do\n\nIs it sensible to assume the customer measures everything in inches?\n\nIt’s never sensible to assume anything about a project.
