    "text": "A program is a sequence of actions performed in order\n\nA script is a type of program that often repeats a series of simple tasks\n\nPython programs are stored as text files, traditionally with a .py extension\n\n\n\n\nTo run a program, you first need to write it. Any text editor should do.\n\n\n\nOpen a text editor and enter the following into the file,\n2+2\nSave the file somewhere appropriate with a name and the .py extension. Then run the program, if you have IDLE you can run it through that. I personally use the command line as\npython path-to-file\nYou may need to use python3 or python3.X depending on how your environment is setup where X is the python subversion. The code should execute but produce no output.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the example produce an empty output when run as a program, but \\(4\\) when run through the interpreter?\n\nProgram returns \\(4\\) to the caller, which for the program, is the shell that executes it\nWhat we really want is to output to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: Python Data Processing with I/O\nconfig:\n  flowchart:\n    htmlLabels: false\n---\nflowchart LR\n\ninput((\"Python\n        Commands\"))\ncomputer[\"Python Command Shell\"]\noutput((\"Results\"))\nuser[\"User\"]\n\ninput--&gt;computer\ncomputer--&gt;output\nuser &lt;--&gt; computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want the program to be able to interact with the user to provide output, and request input\n\nThe first such function we need is print\n\n\n\n\nWrite a python file (using_print.py) with the following contents\n\nprint(2+2)\n\n4\n\n\nNow run the program. It should produce the same output as above (\\(4\\)). On my machine, running the following in terminal, leads to the output \\(4\\) as expected\nuv run using_print.py\n4\nNow create a new file (using_print2.py) with the following contents\n\nprint('The answer is: ')\nprint(2 + 2)\n\nThe answer is: \n4\n\n\nSave and run this file. The output should match the above\nObserve here that the program automatically adds a new line, if we want to avoid that we can instead write\n\nprint('The answer is:', 2+2)\n\nThe answer is: 4\n\n\nWrite and run a new file (using_print3.py) containing the above line and check the output matches the above.\nHere we see that one of the ways to call print is to provide a comma seperated list of values. By default print adds a space between these elements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere are several ways a python program can fail, for example\n\nprint('The answer is: '}\n\n\n  Cell In[4], line 1\n    print('The answer is: '}\n                           ^\nSyntaxError: closing parenthesis '}' does not match opening parenthesis '('\n\n\n\n\nleads to a syntax error, because the wrong parentheses have been used. Or,\n\nPrint(2 + 2)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[5], line 1\n----&gt; 1 Print(2 + 2)\n\nNameError: name 'Print' is not defined\n\n\n\nleads to a NameError because function names are case sensitive, and we have put Print not print. Proper use of tooling can catch these syntax and other errors before you run the code, however sometimes errors slip through and you end up with errors occuring at run time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries provide additional built in functions, like ord and chr already seen\nLibraries can be supplied built-in, i.e. supplied with the python install, or installed later\n\n\n\n\nProvides a source of random numbers\nTo add a library we use the import command, e.g. import random\n\ni.e. import then the name of the library\n\nWe can then use functions from the library with the format, module_name.function_name(arguments)\n\ne.g. for random we can use randint as random.randint(1,6) to generate a random number from \\(1\\) to \\(6\\)\n\n\n\n\nWrite and run a python program containing the following lines\n\nimport random\nprint('You have rolled:', random.randint(1,6))\n\nYou have rolled: 6\n\n\nTry running this program multiple times and see what the output is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf we try calling random.randint without importing random we will get a NameError since neither random or randint will be recognised by the interpreter.\nIf we get the name of the module wrong, e.g. import Random, then we should get a ModuleNotFoundError\n\n\n\nThe python shell and most modern text editors can access documentation about pythons functions to help you with using them, typically by hovering over the function name. Try this in your setup, in mine I get the documentation:\n\ndef randint(a : int, b : int) -&gt; int\nReturn random integer in range [a,b], including both end points\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time function contains functions for managing dates and times\nThe sleep function lets a program for a given time period\n\nTells the operating system to pause execution of the program for a set time period\nOther programs continue running as normal\n\n\n\n\nWrite an execute the following program\n\nimport time\nprint('I will need to think about that...')\ntime.sleep(5)\nprint('The answer is: 42')\n\nI will need to think about that...\nThe answer is: 42\n\n\nYou should see the program print the first line, pause for about \\(5\\) seconds, then print the second line. The above shell should show the code after all lines have run\n\n\nMake an egg timer program. The program should allow the user to time a 5-minute boiled egg. You can do this by modifying the example sleep program which paused for \\(5\\) seconds. For extra style points, you could make the program print, “Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready,” \\(30\\) seconds before the \\(5\\)-minute deadline. You could even expand this into an interactive recipe program that describes the steps to be performed at each point in the recipe and then pauses until the next step is performed\nCurrently we haven’t been show a way to get input from the user so we can’t add that final step of interactivity. But the first two are fairly simple. There are \\(300\\) seconds in \\(5\\) minutes. So we want to tell the user to put the egg in, then sleep for \\(270\\) seconds, then print our message to get ready, sleep for another \\(30\\) seconds then tell the user to remove the egg.\nThe final code is then, (with sample output)\nimport time\n\nprint('Make sure the water is boiling!!!')\nprint('Drop the egg in...')\ntime.sleep(270)\nprint('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Egg cooked, remove now.')\n\n\nMake sure the water is boiling!!!\nDrop the egg in...\nNearly cooked, get your spoon ready\nEgg cooked, remove now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments are used to add metadata to code, i.e. extra information that does not impact how the code is run\ne.g. version numbers, authorship attribution, modification dates\nA comment is marked with a # and extends to the end of the line\n\n#Egg Timer program 1.0 by Rob Miles\nimport time\nprint('Put the egg in boiling water now!')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Take the egg out now')\n\nComments can be added at the end of statements, e.g.\n\ntime.sleep(300) #sleep while egg cooks (300 seconds or 5 minutes)\n\nThe above comment is good because it explains why the function is called\nA bad comment simply repeats the code\nComments have a maintainence overhead, you must keep them consistent with the surrounding code or they will generate confusion\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use sleep to delay the end of a program. This can be useful in some environments where the calling window automatically closes after the program finishes execution, sleep lets you actually see the output\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps is a library provided with the book code that provides simple functions for working with text, images and sound\nUses the pygame library\n\n\n\n\nPygame is a not packaged with python: we have to install it\nNormally this is done through a package manager, pip is a python package manager provided with python\nIn a terminal run one of the following lines,\n\npy -m pip install pygame --user #Windows\npython -m pip install pygame --user #Mac or Linux\n\nYou may need to use python3 instead of python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstalling python packages and python package management is a whole issue. In general one should prefer virtual environments, user installations to isolate packages to the specific project. A program that I use that assists with all of this is called uv. In uv a package is added with the command uv add package-name. Package management and uv is a complicated topic, but to get started look at their homepage which is quite well documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snaps library, is a python file contained in the provided book sample code, in each chapter folder with examples.\n\nIf you want to use snaps we could install it, but this is a bit more involved than where we are at right now\nInstead simply copy it into the same folder as any python file that wants to use it\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps contains a display_message function that takes a string of text and displays it on the screen\n\n\n\n\nThe first example uses the most basic form of display_message\n\n# Displaying Text via Snaps\n\nfrom snaps import *\nimport time\n\ndisplay_message('hello world')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nThe above creates a window with red text saying ‘Hello World’.\n\nWe’ve added the sleep so the window doesn’t automatically close - see discussion about Delaying the end of a program\n\nThe from snaps import * is an alternate import structure\n\nIt says’s from the module snaps import everything (*)\nThis means we don’t need to use the snaps prefix\nGenerally avoid doing this as it can mean that different packages with the same function names will cause naming clashes\n\nPython functions support optional arguments\n\nThese are arguments that have some default supplied value\nWe can customise these to change function behaviour\n\nThe second example uses these optional arguments to change the size, colour and alignment of the text\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('This is smaller text in green on the top left', color=(0, 255, 0), size=50, horiz='left', vert='top')\ntime.sleep(5) #so window doesn't immediately close\n\n\n\n\n\nLike display_message, the display_image function in snaps can be used to display an image file.\nFunction takes the path to the image and can be an png or jpeg\nText can be overlayed on an image by calling display_message after `display_image*\n\n\n\n\nHere we use display_image to render a jpeg, with some overlayed text\n\n#display an image using snaps library\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('Housemartins.jpg')\nsnaps.display_message('Hull Rocks', color=(255, 255, 255), vert='top')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain note, that sleep is used to prevent the window from closing\nThe order of the display messages matters, try changing the order and seeing the result\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have text and images, the last we need is sound, snaps has the play_sound function for this purpose\n\n\n\n\nHere we use play_sound to play a .wav audio file\n\n#play an audio file using snaps\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain, note we need to use sleep to prevent the program immediately ending, which will make it seem like the sound doesn’t play!\nIf you want to work with audio files, a commonly used program is Audacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the snaps program to add visuals and sound to some of the previous examples\n\n\n\nUse the snaps program to make an egg-timer\nOur implementation is a modification of Exercise 3.1, essentially replacing the print with snaps display_message\n# reimplements the Egg Timer Exercise using the snaps library\n# to add a visual and audio component\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('egg_timer_background.png')\nsnaps.display_message('Drop the egg in boiling water',\n                      color=(255, 0, 0), vert='top', size=100)\ntime.sleep(270)\nsnaps.display_message('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready!',\n                      color=(0, 0, 255), size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\nsnaps.display_message('Egg cooked, remove now.',\n                      color=(0, 255, 0), vert='bottom', size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\n\nWe first set the background using display_image\n\nThis means the text will appear over the top of the background image\n\nWe then display the initial message\n\nThis is displayed in red, at the top, we adjust the size of the text to \\(100\\) so the text fits on the window\n\nWe then sleep for the first \\(4.5\\) minutes\nWe then inform the user that there is \\(30\\) seconds to go, like in the original code.\n\nThis time the text is displayed in blue, and migrates to the middle of the screen\n\nWe then sleep again for the last \\(30\\) seconds\nFinally we first play a sound to alert the user\nWe then display the message that the egg is ready\n\nThis time at the bottom and in red\n\nWe then sleep for \\(30\\) seconds so the user has time to notice and hear the sound\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a high-low party game. The game works like this,\n\nThe program displays a number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) inclusive\nThe program then sleeps for \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is asleep, the players are invited to decide if the next number is higher or lower than the number just printed. Players who chose high stand on the right. Players who chose low stand on the left\nThe program then displays a second number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\), and anyone who was wrong is eliminated from the game. The program is then re-run with the players that are left until you have a winner\n\nFor fun we use snaps for our implementation to make this visual\n# High-Low\n# Implements the High-Low Party game\n# Generates a random number in the interval [1, 10]\n# Sleeps for a period of time\n# Shows another number\n# Players are asked to guess if this second number will be higher or lower\n\nimport snaps\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('The first number is...')\ntime.sleep(5) #sleep so people can read the first message\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(3) # leave time to read the number\nsnaps.display_message('Will the next be higher or lower?')\n\n# sleep for 20 seconds total, with a message to raise the tension with 5s left\ntime.sleep(15)\nsnaps.display_message('The second number is...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(10) # leave time for the players to read\n\nObserve that we have to wrap the display_message calls with calls to sleep to ensure that there is time for the user to read the messages\nThe output of (a terminal implementation of the program) should look something like,\n\n\n\nThe first number is:  9\nWill the next be higher or lower?\nThe second number is:  5\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a Nerves of Steel game. This game works like this\n\nThe program displays “Players Stand”\nThe program sleeps for a random time between \\(5\\) and \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is sleeping, players can sit down. Keep track of the last person to sit down\nThe program displays “Last to sit down wins.” Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down\n\n\nAgain for fun we’ll use snaps to make a basic window.\n\n# Nerves of Steel\n# Implements the Nerves of Steel Party Game\n# Players stand\n# Generates a random time interval\n# All players standing after the time interval expires lose\n# Last to sit down before the interval expires wins\n\nimport snaps\n\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('Players Stand')\ntime.sleep(random.randint(5, 20))\nsnaps.display_message('Last to sit down wins', color=(0, 255, 0))\n\ntime.sleep(5) #so program doesn't immediately end\n\nWe add a sleep at the end so the players have time to read the text. We also switch the final text from the initial red to green to celebrate the winner\nThe output of a terminal-based implementation might look like,\n\n\n\nPlayers Stand\nLast to sit down wins",

Package management and uv is a complicated topic, but to get started look at their homepage which is quite well documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snaps library, is a python file contained in the provided book sample code, in each chapter folder with examples.\n\nIf you want to use snaps we could install it, but this is a bit more involved than where we are at right now\nInstead simply copy it into the same folder as any python file that wants to use it\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps contains a display_message function that takes a string of text and displays it on the screen\n\n\n\n\nThe first example uses the most basic form of display_message\n\n# Displaying Text via Snaps\n\nfrom snaps import *\nimport time\n\ndisplay_message('hello world')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nThe above creates a window with red text saying ‘Hello World’.\n\nWe’ve added the sleep so the window doesn’t automatically close - see discussion about Delaying the end of a program\n\nThe from snaps import * is an alternate import structure\n\nIt says’s from the module snaps import everything (*)\nThis means we don’t need to use the snaps prefix\nGenerally avoid doing this as it can mean that different packages with the same function names will cause naming clashes\n\nPython functions support optional arguments\n\nThese are arguments that have some default supplied value\nWe can customise these to change function behaviour\n\nThe second example uses these optional arguments to change the size, colour and alignment of the text\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('This is smaller text in green on the top left', color=(0, 255, 0), size=50, horiz='left', vert='top')\ntime.sleep(5) #so window doesn't immediately close\n\n\n\n\n\nLike display_message, the display_image function in snaps can be used to display an image file.\nFunction takes the path to the image and can be an png or jpeg\nText can be overlayed on an image by calling display_message after `display_image*\n\n\n\n\nHere we use display_image to render a jpeg, with some overlayed text\n\n#display an image using snaps library\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('Housemartins.jpg')\nsnaps.display_message('Hull Rocks', color=(255, 255, 255), vert='top')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain note, that sleep is used to prevent the window from closing\nThe order of the display messages matters, try changing the order and seeing the result\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have text and images, the last we need is sound, snaps has the play_sound function for this purpose\n\n\n\n\nHere we use play_sound to play a .wav audio file\n\n#play an audio file using snaps\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain, note we need to use sleep to prevent the program immediately ending, which will make it seem like the sound doesn’t play!\nIf you want to work with audio files, a commonly used program is Audacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the snaps program to add visuals and sound to some of the previous examples\n\n\n\nUse the snaps program to make an egg-timer\nOur implementation is a modification of Exercise 3.1, essentially replacing the print with snaps display_message\n# reimplements the Egg Timer Exercise using the snaps library\n# to add a visual and audio component\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('egg_timer_background.png')\nsnaps.display_message('Drop the egg in boiling water',\n                      color=(255, 0, 0), vert='top', size=100)\ntime.sleep(270)\nsnaps.display_message('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready!',\n                      color=(0, 0, 255), size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\nsnaps.display_message('Egg cooked, remove now.',\n                      color=(0, 255, 0), vert='bottom', size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\n\nWe first set the background using display_image\n\nThis means the text will appear over the top of the background image\n\nWe then display the initial message\n\nThis is displayed in red, at the top, we adjust the size of the text to \\(100\\) so the text fits on the window\n\nWe then sleep for the first \\(4.5\\) minutes\nWe then inform the user that there is \\(30\\) seconds to go, like in the original code.\n\nThis time the text is displayed in blue, and migrates to the middle of the screen\n\nWe then sleep again for the last \\(30\\) seconds\nFinally we first play a sound to alert the user\nWe then display the message that the egg is ready\n\nThis time at the bottom and in red\n\nWe then sleep for \\(30\\) seconds so the user has time to notice and hear the sound\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a high-low party game. The game works like this,\n\nThe program displays a number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) inclusive\nThe program then sleeps for \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is asleep, the players are invited to decide if the next number is higher or lower than the number just printed. Players who chose high stand on the right. Players who chose low stand on the left\nThe program then displays a second number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\), and anyone who was wrong is eliminated from the game. The program is then re-run with the players that are left until you have a winner\n\nFor fun we use snaps for our implementation to make this visual\n# High-Low\n# Implements the High-Low Party game\n# Generates a random number in the interval [1, 10]\n# Sleeps for a period of time\n# Shows another number\n# Players are asked to guess if this second number will be higher or lower\n\nimport snaps\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('The first number is...')\ntime.sleep(5) #sleep so people can read the first message\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(3) # leave time to read the number\nsnaps.display_message('Will the next be higher or lower?')\n\n# sleep for 20 seconds total, with a message to raise the tension with 5s left\ntime.sleep(15)\nsnaps.display_message('The second number is...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(10) # leave time for the players to read\n\nObserve that we have to wrap the display_message calls with calls to sleep to ensure that there is time for the user to read the messages\nThe output of (a terminal implementation of the program) should look something like,\n\n\n\nThe first number is:  9\nWill the next be higher or lower?\nThe second number is:  5\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a Nerves of Steel game. This game works like this\n\nThe program displays “Players Stand”\nThe program sleeps for a random time between \\(5\\) and \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is sleeping, players can sit down. Keep track of the last person to sit down\nThe program displays “Last to sit down wins.” Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down\n\n\nAgain for fun we’ll use snaps to make a basic window.\n\n# Nerves of Steel\n# Implements the Nerves of Steel Party Game\n# Players stand\n# Generates a random time interval\n# All players standing after the time interval expires lose\n# Last to sit down before the interval expires wins\n\nimport snaps\n\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('Players Stand')\ntime.sleep(random.randint(5, 20))\nsnaps.display_message('Last to sit down wins', color=(0, 255, 0))\n\ntime.sleep(5) #so program doesn't immediately end\n\nWe add a sleep at the end so the players have time to read the text. We also switch the final text from the initial red to green to celebrate the winner\nThe output of a terminal-based implementation might look like,\n\n\n\nPlayers Stand\nLast to sit down wins",

    "text": "Question and Answers\n\nWould a user ever use the Python Command Shell?\n\nThe command shell is very useful for programmers. Programmers can toy with code to check the output. Typically a user won’t interact with the shell but a program instead\n\nWhat would happen if two libraries contain a function with the same name?\n\nIf we use the import library approach nothing. Since functions are namespaced by their library we would simply have library1.function and library2.function\ne.g. we might have user.menu and system.menu\nIf we use the from library import * function then we might have an issue as the names will clash\n\nCan I make comments more than one line long?\n\nSeveral languages support multiline comments (e.g. Java, C, C#), these are comments that by default span multiple lines\nPython requires you to use multiple #, i.e. one for each line\n\nThis is referred to as only supporting single line comments\n\nLater we’ll see a syntax for adding multiline strings that can be used for documentation in a similar way to multiline comments\n\nCan a python program run on any computer?\n\nYes and No. If a computer has a python interpreter installed then code should be able to run on it. However, there are caveats, the computer might require the same version of python and any libraries used some of which may be hardware or software dependent, e.g. a library might be specifically written to utilise the Windows API\n\nIs the python language the same on every machine?\n\nAgain Yes and No. Every computer should have the same core language, however different computers may have different versions of the same language which have slightly different feature sets. In fact it is often common for the same computer to manage several different python versions in different virtual environments\nMore common is for different computers to rely on libraries, that may not be commonly shared and may rely on hardware or software specific features to run.\n\nCan I use Snaps in my program?\n\nYes, it is provided by the book author to be used",

Plugging this into the shell,\n\n(2 + 3) * 4\n\n20\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3*4?\n\nWe might expect a syntax error, instead the interpreter, simply goes to a new line, and waits for us to enter the matching parenthesis. One such sequence in the shell might be,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n)\n\n14\n\n\nThese notes use a slightly different version of a python interpreter called a Jupyter Notebook to render the inline code. In Jupyter Notebooks code is written in cells and executed cell-by cell. This means that the interpreter can’t wait for the user to provide the missing input, so instead we get the slightly different error message below,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n\n\n  Cell In[8], line 1\n    (2 + 3 * 4\n              ^\nSyntaxError: incomplete input\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate )2+3*4?\n\nIf we see a right parenthesis before a left parenthesis there is no way to retroactively go back and fix the missing left, like in the previous case where the shell simply waited for us to add the parenthesis. So here we would expect a syntax error.\n\n)2+3*4\n\n\n  Cell In[9], line 1\n    )2+3*4\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unmatched ')'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the interpreter like this to work line by line because python is a “scripting” language\n\ni.e. The program reads a line and then interprets the output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot all languages are scripting languages\nNot all languages are scripting languages. Some are converted to low-level hardware instructions. This is called compilation, and in place of an interpreter it requires a compiler to convert the code. Compiled programs are typically faster, since they can be optimised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers fundamentally represent data as \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in binary\n\nWe build up layers of abstract that let us handle concepts like numbers, characters and strings of text\n\nData can be regarded as the stored values representing information\nInformation is thus the interpretation of data, to mean something\n\n\n\n\nPython scripts thus can be considered data processors\n\nThe script is interpreted and converted to output\n\n\n\n\nStart up the python interpreter and run the following\n\n'hello'\n\n 'hello'\n\n'hello'\n\n\n\nLike before with \\(2\\) the word is echoed.\n\n`‘hello’ + ’ world’\n\n 'hello' + 'world'\n\n'helloworld'\n\n\n\n“Adding” two words performs a string concatenation\nObserve we explicitly have to include the space character in one of the strings\nA cool observation is that + changes it’s behaviour in response to what it’s arguments are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if missed the closing quote of a string you were typing?\n\nWe would expect it, to either hang waiting for the closing quote like with the missing left parenthesis, or a syntax error like a right quote. We find,\n\n\n'hello\n\n\n  Cell In[12], line 1\n    'hello\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nEOL stands for “End of Line”\nOperands like strings and numbers can’t span multiple lines\nA string literal is just a string there in the code\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to subtract one string from another?\n\nWhile addition of strings can be easily seen as concatenation, there is no meaningful equivalent for substraction.\nWe could think of it as substring removal, but that has a lot of nuance that is hard to capture in a single symbol.

Plugging this into the shell,\n\n(2 + 3) * 4\n\n20\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate (2+3*4?\n\nWe might expect a syntax error, instead the interpreter, simply goes to a new line, and waits for us to enter the matching parenthesis. One such sequence in the shell might be,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n)\n\n14\n\n\nThese notes use a slightly different version of a python interpreter called a Jupyter Notebook to render the inline code. In Jupyter Notebooks code is written in cells and executed cell-by cell. This means that the interpreter can’t wait for the user to provide the missing input, so instead we get the slightly different error message below,\n\n(2 + 3 * 4\n\n\n  Cell In[8], line 1\n    (2 + 3 * 4\n              ^\nSyntaxError: incomplete input\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to evaluate )2+3*4?\n\nIf we see a right parenthesis before a left parenthesis there is no way to retroactively go back and fix the missing left, like in the previous case where the shell simply waited for us to add the parenthesis. So here we would expect a syntax error.\n\n)2+3*4\n\n\n  Cell In[9], line 1\n    )2+3*4\n    ^\nSyntaxError: unmatched ')'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the interpreter like this to work line by line because python is a “scripting” language\n\ni.e. The program reads a line and then interprets the output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNot all languages are scripting languages\nNot all languages are scripting languages. Some are converted to low-level hardware instructions. This is called compilation, and in place of an interpreter it requires a compiler to convert the code. Compiled programs are typically faster, since they can be optimised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers fundamentally represent data as \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in binary\n\nWe build up layers of abstract that let us handle concepts like numbers, characters and strings of text\n\nData can be regarded as the stored values representing information\nInformation is thus the interpretation of data, to mean something\n\n\n\n\nPython scripts thus can be considered data processors\n\nThe script is interpreted and converted to output\n\n\n\n\nStart up the python interpreter and run the following\n\n'hello'\n\n 'hello'\n\n'hello'\n\n\n\nLike before with \\(2\\) the word is echoed.\n\n`‘hello’ + ’ world’\n\n 'hello' + 'world'\n\n'helloworld'\n\n\n\n“Adding” two words performs a string concatenation\nObserve we explicitly have to include the space character in one of the strings\nA cool observation is that + changes it’s behaviour in response to what it’s arguments are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if missed the closing quote of a string you were typing?\n\nWe would expect it, to either hang waiting for the closing quote like with the missing left parenthesis, or a syntax error like a right quote.

If we want a computer to reject negative ages, we must actually build that understanding into the program\n\nIf the output from a program is settings for the fuel-injection system on a car, is the output data or information?\n\nAs soon as something starts acting on data, it becomes information. A human being is not doing anything with these values, but they will cause the speed of the engine to change, which might affect humans, so this makes the output information rather than data by the authors opinion\n\nIs the computer stupid because it can’t understand English?\n\nNo, english can be a quite ambiguous languge. The legal profession is an example of somewhere were debate over the semantics of language is tricky\n\nIf I don’t know how to solve a problem, can I write a program to do it?\n\nNo, you need to understand the solution before you can write it and make sure that it does exactly what you want it to do\n\nIs it sensible to assume the customer measures everything in inches?\n\nIt’s never sensible to assume anything about a project.

On the left we have the variable, then = which means assignment, followed by the expression to assign\nThe assignment expression does not need to be made of simple primitives, e.g. total = us_sales + world_wide_sales defines the variable total to be equal to the sum of the variables us_sales and world_wide_sales\n\n\n\nStart up a python interpreter, then run the following commands in sequence\n\ntotal = 0\n\n total = 0\n\n\nNo output is generated, the assignment is performed silently\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n0\n\n\n\n0 output\ntotal has been assigned 0, putting the variable name into the terminal returns the value associated with this value\n\ntotal = total + 10\n\n total = total + 10\n\n\nNo output\nLike with the first statement, variable assignment generates no output\nHere we assign total the value given by the current value of total plus \\(10\\)\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n10\n\n\n\n10 output\nThe new value of total is printed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables require names\nPython variable names must obey a number of rules\n\nMust start with a letter or _\nCan contain letters, numbers or _ characters\n\nSome valid names are\n\ntotal\nxyz -t0tal\n\nSome invalid names are\n\n2_be_or_not_to_be\n\nStarts with a number which is not allowed\n\ntot@l\n\n@ is not a valid character for a variable name\n\n\nPython names are case sensitive, i.e. FRED and fred are distinct variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCreate Meaningful Names\nDon’t use silly or meaningless names like hello_mom. Use meaningful names that convey information about what they represent like length or length_in_centimetres. The PEP8 style guide, sets out how to write and format python programs. This includes a section on naming conventions\nSome languages recommend using camel case for variable naming. In this format words in a variable are distinguished by capital letters, but the first letter of the variable is lower case, e.g. lengthInCentimetres. Camel case is called this because the capital letters look like the humps of a camel. Either standard works, but when writing python it is best to stick to the python style guides\n\n\n\nPython does not limit the length of variable names\n\nThere should be no performance cost associated with long variable names\nLonger names can be hard to read\nNames should be no longer than they need to convey clear meaning\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve already seen that python can generate errors when it is unable to interpret an input. Answer the following questions to investigate how errors can arise in using variables. Assume that total has already been defined\n\nCan you identify an error in the statement below, which is supposed to add \\(10\\) to the variable total?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n Total = total + 10\n\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. Therefore Total and total are distinct variables. So this declares a new variable Total and assigns it the value of total + 10. The value of total itself is unchanged.\nThis is a logic error, it is a legal statement in python that generates the wrong behaviour\n\nLogic errors are some of the hardest errors to deal with since they (typically) don’t stop a program running, they just produce incorrect behaviour\nPython typically cannot warn you about them ahead of time\n\nThis variable misassignment is why python style guides recommend the use of all lowercase letters for variable names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOther languages with more strict type systems and variable declarations, may be able to identify logic errors like the one above.\n\n\nHow do we prevent logic errors?\n\nTesting\n\ni.e checking that the actual behaviour of a program matches the expected behaviour\nRun a program with input that will generate a known output when running correctly\n\nVerify the program generates this output\n\n\nTesting doesn’t guarantee a program is correct\n\nTypically hard to check all inputs and use cases\nDoes however give confidence and can provide that a program isn’t correct\n\nTypically tests should be written as the program is created or if using test-driven development the tests are written before the program itself is written\n\nThe statement below also contains a misspelling of the variable total. However, this time the name on the right-hand side of the equals is mispelled. What will happen when this program runs?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n total = Total + 10\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[9], line 2\n      1 total = 0\n----&gt; 2 total = Total + 10\n\nNameError: name 'Total' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, Total is not defined as a variable, so there is no meaningful way to interpret a value. Hence we would expect an error. Since the error is that Total doesn’t exist, we see a NameError.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the Nerves of Steel exercise from Chapter 3. In the game, players must remain standing right up to the moment before they think a random timer will expire\nOne suggestion is that the game might provide more skill if the program told the players how long they had to stand. The game now functions as a “Self-Timer”, the winner is now arguably the person who can best keep track of the time\nThe “game” sequence is\n\nSet the time to remain standing to a random number\nDisplay time to remain standing\nSleep for the time to remain standing\nDisplay a message for the winner\n\nObserve that the time is required to be used in two places, displaying the time remaining and then sleeping for that period of time. This means we need to use a variable to store the value of the time remaining\n# Chapter 4 Example 2: Self Timer\n# Based on original code by Rob Miles\n# Extends the Nerves of Steel Game from Chapter 3, by adding a skill element\n# with the players being informed of how long they have to stand for\n\nimport time\nimport random\n\nprint('Welcome to Self Timer')\nprint() #just prints a newline\nprint('Everybody stand up')\nprint('Stay standing until you think the time has ended')\nprint('Then sit down')\nprint('Anyone still standing when the time expires loses')\nprint('The last person to sit down before the time ended will win')\n\nstand_time = random.randint(5, 20) #generate the time to stand for\n\nprint('Stay standing for', stand_time, 'seconds.') #display standing time\ntime.sleep(stand_time) #sleep for the standing time\nprint('****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****')\n\n\nWelcome to Self Timer\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing until you think the time has ended\nThen sit down\nAnyone still standing when the time expires loses\nThe last person to sit down before the time ended will win\nStay standing for 15 seconds.\n****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****\n\n\n\nMost of the code is just text, but the key takeaway is the line stand_time = random.randint(5, 20) which assigns stand_time the result of random.randint(5, 20), i.e a random number from 5 to 20 inclusive\nWe then call stand_time is our call to print to display the time, and then sleep for the same amount of time\nObserve we couldn’t just write the number into both functions explicitly since it’s randomly generated, we would need to know ahead of time what the value will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables can also hold text, e.g. customer_name = 'fred' assigns the string 'fred' to customer_name\nCan use a string variable anywhere we would use a string literal, e.g. message = 'the name is ' + customer_name performs the string concatenation of 'the name is' and the value of customer_name and assigns the result to message\n\n\n\nPython tracks the contents of each variable and only allows operations that make sense. Using the python interpreter experiment with the following combinations of string and number variables.\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 25\ncustomer_name = 'fred'\n\nAfter entering the above two lines in the interpreter, run the following line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[12], line 1\n----&gt; 1 customer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n\n\n\nHere we are trying to add a number and a string, which we saw previously shouldn’t work. The terminal should provide some error output like the below\nNow try the below line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 'Fred'\n\nOne might expect the above to generate an error, after all we assign text to a variable that was just storing a number. Instead python simply discards the old numeric value of the variable, and now stores text in customer_age_in_years. You should generally avoid doing this, being able to reason about the type of a variable is typically an important part of safe and effective programming, and the weak typing of python is typically disliked outside of quick prototyping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above behaviour is an example of python as a what’s called a weakly typed language. Types are a quite developed part of programming theory that can be discussed later. In some languages, types are enforced to greater degrees of strictness. In some languages (like C) you can assign variables compatible types, i.e. ones that can be converted to the variable’s inate type. In other stricter languages a variable can only hold the exact specified type\nThe more strictly a language enforces its typing system typically the harder it is to generate errors at runtime, however they are often correspondingly more painful to actually write the code in the first place",
