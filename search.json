    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nA number of the code examples in this use the file siren.wav, this can be found in the corresponding chapter in the samples submodule. For space reasons we haven’t uploaded it to the github\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean values are a type that is used to distinguish between values that are True or False\nFor example, we could use an int to count the number of hairs on a person’s head, but a bool to indicate if they are bald\n\n\n\n\nSimply declare a variable with a value of True or False\n\nPython will infer the type\n\nFor example, to declare a true valued boolean,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = True\n\nwe can then set the value to false,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = False\n\nNote that True and False are python keywords, and are case-sensitive, e.g. true and false will not work as expected\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the python interpreter and work through the following questions to understand booleans\n\n*What do you think would happen if you printed the contents of a boolean value?\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = True\nprint(it_is_time_to_get_up)\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nPython will try to print out something meaningful, for a boolean this is either True or False\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you gave the word True to the input function?\nx = input(\"True or False: \")\nTrue or False: True\n\ninput returns it’s input as a string, so in this case x will not be a bool but rather a string with the value 'True'\n\nIs there a python function called bool that will convert things into Boolean, just like there are int and float functions?\n\nYes there is, consistent behaviour with bool. Consider the following examples\n\n\nprint(bool(1))\nprint(bool(0))\nprint(bool(0.0))\nprint(bool(0.1))\nprint(bool(''))\nprint(bool('Hello'))\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\nWe can see that non-zero numbers evaluate True while zero, evaluates as False. Similarly the empty string evaluates False while a non-empty string evaluates as True\n\nWhat happens if a program combines bool values with other values?\n\nWe should already expect that if we try to mix incompatible data that an error should be generated\n\n\n 'Hello' + True\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'Hello' + True\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"bool\") to str\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that we cannot concatenate a boolean value to a string\nThe behaviour can be a little less intuitive with numbers though,\n\n\n1 + True\n\n2\n\n\n\nTrue is implicitly converted to the integer value \\(1\\)\n\n\n1 + False\n\n1\n\n\n\nSimilarly, False is implicitly converted to the intger value \\(0\\)\nWe can see that numeric operations on bool thus have well-allowed behaviour but we cannot do the same with textual data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally we don’t declare a boolean with True or False explicitly but instead as the result of evaluating an expression\n\nSome expressions evaluate to True or False which naturally suits being stored in a boolean\n\nConsider a simple alarm clock,\n\nWe can get the time through the time library we’ve seen before\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\n\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\ntime.localtime returns an object containing information about the current time.\n\nThis different blocks of information are called attributes, below is a list of the attributes contained in the object returned by localtime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nValue\n\n\n\n\ntm_year\nYear (for example, 2017)\n\n\ntm_mon\nMonth (in the range 1 … 12, 1 represents January)\n\n\ntm_mday\nDay in the Month (in the range 1 … month length)\n\n\ntm_hour\nHour in the Day (in the range 0 … 23)\n\n\ntm_min\nMinute in the Hour ( in the range 0 … 59)\n\n\ntm_sec\nSeconds in the Minute ( in the range 0 … 59)\n\n\ntm_wday\nDay of the Week (in the range 0 … 6 with Monday as 0)\n\n\ntm_yday\nDay in the Year (in the range 0 … 364 or 365 depending on if the year is a leap year)\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a localtime object might look like,\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nValue\n\n\n\n\ntm_year\n2017\n\n\ntm_mon\n7\n\n\ntm_mday\n19\n\n\ntm_hour\n11\n\n\ntm_min\n40\n\n\ntm_sec\n30\n\n\ntm_wday\n2\n\n\ntm_yday\n200\n\n\n\n\n\nLets make a clock that displays only the hour value, using localtime. These one-handed clocks are supposed promote a more relaxed attitude. Create a new program (OneHandedClock.py) and copy the below text.\n\n# Example 5.1: One Handed Clock\n# Uses time to display the hour\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\n\nprint(\"The hour is:\", hour)\n\nThe hour is: 12\n\n\nRun the program, it should print out the current hour\n\n\n\nImprove the previous example to produce a more fully featured clock that reports the time, and date when run\nWe can use the table above to grab the correct attributes. We then simply need to format the attribute as nessecary. The final program is given below\n\n# Exercise 5.1: Improved Clock\n# An improved clock that displays the date and time when run\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_datetime = time.localtime()\n\nday = current_datetime.tm_mday\nmonth = current_datetime.tm_mon\nyear = current_datetime.tm_year\nprint(\"The date is\", day, \"/\", month, \"/\", year)\n\nseconds = current_datetime.tm_sec\nminutes = current_datetime.tm_min\nhours = current_datetime.tm_hour\nprint(\"The time is\", hours, \":\", minutes, \":\", seconds)\n\nThe date is 9 / 12 / 2025\nThe time is 12 : 5 : 55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen expressions as being made of operators and operands\nOne type of operator is a comparison operator\n\nReturns a value that is True or False, e.g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 3\n    space\n    title[\"Breakdown of an Example Comparison Expression\"]\n    space\n\n    block:Input\n    columns 1\n        operand1[\"hour\"]\n        operand1Word[\"Operand\"]\n        operand1descr[\"(thing to work on)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Middle\n    columns 1\n        operator[\"&gt;\"]\n        operatorWord[\"Operator\"]\n        operatorDescr[\"(thing to do)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Output\n    columns 1\n        operand2[\"6\"]\n        operand2Word[\"Operand\"]\n        operand2descr[\"(thing to work on)\"]\n    end\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass operand2Word BG\nclass operand2descr BG\nclass operand1Word BG\nclass operand1descr BG\nclass operatorWord BG\nclass operatorDescr BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a table of the common comparison operators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nName\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\\(&gt;\\)\nGreater than\nTrue if the left argument is greater than the right, else False\n\n\n\\(&lt;\\)\nLess than\nTrue if the left argument less than the right, else False\n\n\n\\(&gt;=\\)\nGreater than or Equal\nAs for Greater than but also True if the left argument equals the right\n\n\n\\(&lt;=\\)\nLess than or Equal\nAs for Less than but also True if the left argument equals the right\n\n\n\\(==\\)\nEquals\nTrue if the left argument equals the right argument, else False\n\n\n\\(!=\\)\nNot Equals\nTrue if the left argument does not equal the right argument, else False\n\n\n\n\nA program can use a comparison operator to set a boolean variable, e.g. the below code fragment which sets the boolean variable it_is_time_to_get_up to True if the variable hour is greater than \\(6\\) else sets it to False\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = hour &gt; 6\n\n\nUse the python interpreter to work through the following questions in order to understand Comparison Operators\n\nHow does the equality operator work?\n\nThe equality operator evaluates to True if the two operands hold the same value\n\n\n1 == 1\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nThe equality operator can be used to compare strings and bools\n\n\n 'Rob' == 'Rob'\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n True == True\n\nTrue\n\n\nHow do I remember which relational operator to use?\n\nPractice, patience and muscle memory\n\nCan we apply relational operators between other types of expressions?\n\nYes. For example, the \\(&gt;\\) and \\(&lt;\\) operators when used to compare strings will use an alphabetic ordering, e.g.\n\n'Alice' &lt; 'Brian'\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 4 we noted that floating points only approximate a specific real-value. These approximations can cause issues when using comparison operators, e.g.\n\nx = 0.3\ny = 0.1 + 0.2\nx == y\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nThe variables x and y should both notionally store \\(0.3\\), but the equality shows they are unequal. This is because the addition of \\(0.1\\) and \\(0.2\\) actually leads to y storing the slightly inaccurate \\(0.3000...4\\)\nIf comparing floating-point numbers for equality, the best approach is to check that the values are appropriately close\n\n\n\n\nPython provides the type function, type(x) returns the type of the variable x, especially useful for investigating the type of values returned by library functions you’ve never seen before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want to combine boolean expressions to create a new boolean expression\ne.g. An alarm might want to go off when the hour is after \\(7\\) and the minute is after \\(30\\)\nPython provides logic operators for combining boolean expressions\n\n\n\nUse the python interpreter to answer the following questions and investigate boolean operators\n\nWhat does the following expression evaluate too?\n\nnot True\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nnot inverts the value of a boolean, so True is converted to False\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue and True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nand is True iff both arguments are True as is the case above, so the result is True\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue and False\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nSince one of the arguments is False and will evaluate to False\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue or False\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nSince one of the arguments is True or will evaluate to* True\n\nSo far, the examples have only used boolean values. What happens if we mix boolean and numeric values?\n\nTrue and 1\n\n1\n\n\n\nRecall that python can convert numeric expressions to boolean ones, this implicitly happens to the \\(1\\) in the above. So we would expect and to return True. However ,instead \\(1\\) is returned. This is due to some odd python behaviour\n\nPython sees True -&gt; result of and implied by second argument\n\nSo simply returns the second argument, since the truthfulness of \\(1\\), is equivalent to the original expression\n\nIf we flip the arguments, we should see this more clearly\n\n1 and True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nThis time the above expressions should return True\n\nThe same behaviour will also occur with or\n\n1 or False\n\n1\n\n\n\nHere the or operator short-circuits on \\(1\\), so returns \\(1\\)\n\n\n0 or True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nHere the or evaluates the first argument as false, so cannot short-circuit, the second argument is returned, i.e True\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now use and to try construct an expression that will correctly evaluate when the time is after \\(7:30\\), naively we might expect,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = hour &gt; 6 and minute &gt; 29\n\nWe can use a truth table to check,\n\n\n\n\nHour\nMinute\nDesired\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n6\n0\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n7\n29\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n7\n30\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n8\n0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in the last case the result is not what we want!\n\nhour &gt; 7 is true, but minute &gt; 29 is false, so we need to be more precise,\n\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29)\n\nWe use brackets to make the expression more readable\nHere we use short-circuiting, if the the hour is greater than \\(7\\) we don’t need to check the minutes value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen working with boolean operations you should always check that the logic matches what you expect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want a program to tell me if it’s time to get out of bed\nNeed the ability to run code if a boolean condition is met\n\nCan do so using the aptly named if operator\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new python program (SimpleAlarmClock.py) with the following contents\n\n\n# Example 5.2: Simple Alarm Clock\n# Demonstrates `if` using a simple alarm clock\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_sec\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29)\n\nif it_is_time_to_get_up:\n    print(\"IT IS TIME TO GET UP\")\n\nIT IS TIME TO GET UP\n\n\n\nThe program should print IT IS TIME TO GET UP only if the time is after \\(7:30\\)\nThe if construct starts with the word if, following by a boolean value called the condition, then a :\nAny statements we want to execute if the if is True are then written below the if and indented one level\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition is a term for the expression that controls which branch of the if is executed\nIf the condition evaluates True the indented branch is run\nIf the condition evluates False the indented branch is skipped\nWe could simply the above code by including the check directly in the if rather than an intermediate variable\n\n\nif (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minutes &gt; 29):\n    print(\"IT IS TIME TO GET UP\")\n\nIT IS TIME TO GET UP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want multiple statements to run after an if statement\nWe just write them as a sequence of indented statements\n\n\n\nLet us improve the previous example to also play a sound if it’s time to get up. Create a program (SirenAlarmClock.py) with the contents below\n# Example 5.3: Siren Alarm Clock\n# Improves the Simple Alarm Clock to also play a sound\nimport time\n\nimport snaps\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_min\n\nif (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29):\n    snaps.display_message(\"TIME TO GET UP\")\n    snaps.play_sound(\"siren.wav\")\n    # pause the program to give time for the sound to play\n    time.sleep(10)\nThis program now runs three statements in the if\n\nFirst a message is displayed\nSecond a sound is played\nThird the program sleeps so the sound has time to play\n\n\nIf we want something to run regardless of the if condition, we write it either before or after the if statement\n\n\n\n\nAdd to the simple Alarm Clock, by making it so the program will always print the current time regardless of if the alarm goes off. Create a new program (AlarmClockWithTimeDisplay.py). Enter the following contents,\n\n# Example 5.4: Alarm Clock with Time Display\n# A variant of Alarm Clock to also always display the time\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_min\n\nif (hour &gt;

Write a new program (SimpleAlarmClockWithElse.py) with the following contents,\n\n# Example 5.5: Simple Alarm Clock\n# Variant of the Simple Alarm Clock\n# that modifies the output depending on if its time to get up\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_min\n\nif (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29):\n    print(\"IT IS TIME TO GET UP\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Go back to bed\")\n\nIT IS TIME TO GET UP\n\n\n\nObserve that only one line of the paired if-else statements is printed\n\n\n\n\nWork through the following questions to understand if constructions\n\nMust an if construction have an else part?\n\nNo,we saw when first working with if that we could exclude the else in that case no additional code runs if the if evaluates False\n\nWhat happens if a condition is never True?\n\nIt simply never executes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe if statement can be used to compare strings, as seen with the comparison operators\n\n\n\nThe following program uses the equality operator and an if statement to greet a person if their name matches. What is a potential issue with this program?\n# Example 5.6: Broken Greeter\n# A Greeter program using string matching\n# Identify the issues with this program\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name == \"Rob\":\n    print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\nThe equality operator checks against the string \"Rob\" exactly, i.e. it is case sensitive, if we write \"ROB\", or \"rob\" or some variation thereof, the statement will not match.\nWe can fix this by using the string method upper, this converts all forms of the word \"rob\" to \"ROB\" which we can reliably check against. The new program looks like\n# Example 5.7: Uppercase Greeter\n# A Greeter program using string matching\n# Fixes the issues with Example 5.6 by using\n# str.upper()\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name.upper() == \"ROB\":\n    print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\n\nWe could also use the string method lower to compare against an all lowercase word\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions to learn about methods and functions\n\nHow do lower() and upper() work?\n\nPython types are objects that provide methods.\nMethods are called like functions\n\nWhy do we have to write lower() and not lower?\n\nLeave the parentheses off, and see what happens\n\n  name = 'Rob'\n  name.upper\n\n&lt;function str.upper()&gt;\n\n\nWe are instead returned a description of the method itself\n\nWhat’s the difference between functions and methods?\n\nThey are used the same way, but they differ in where they are created\nFunctions are not associated any specific object\nMethods are bound as attributes of objects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can nest conditions, e.g. if you want to perform sequential checks\n\n\n\nLet us demonstrate nested if through a greeter which requires a follow on code word to confirm the identity of the user. Create a program (CodedGreeter.py) with the following contents\n# Example 5.8: Coded Greeter\n# Asks the user for a follow on code to confirm their ID\n# before the program greets them\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name.upper() == \"ROB\":\n    code = input(\"Enter the codeword: \")\n    if code == \"secret\":\n        print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Begone. Imposter\")\n\nPlay around with the above code to see what happens for various input combinations. You should see if the first input is not a variant of \"rob\" the second prompt never occurs and the program ends. Adjust the above by writing a new program (CodedGreeterWithOuterElse.py)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove the Alarm Clock. Make the alarm display the date as well as the time, and let the user sleep in on the weekends.\nOur implementation is given below,\n# Exercise 4.2: Advanced Alarm Clock\n# An Advanced Alarm Combining the Behaviour\n# of most increments of the alarm clock\n# and allowing you to sleep in on weekends\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_min\nday = current_time.tm_mday\nmonth = current_time.tm_mon\nis_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5\n\ndate_message = \"The date is \" + str(day) + \"/\" + str(month)\ntime_message = \"The time is \" + str(hour) + \":\" + str(minute)\n\nmsg = \"\"\nup_hour = 7 + is_weekend  # get to sleep in an extra hour on weekends\n\nif (hour &gt; up_hour) or (hour == up_hour and minute &gt; 29):\n    msg = msg + \"TIME TO GET UP\"\n    snaps.play_sound(\"siren.wav\")\nelse:\n    msg = msg + \"Go back to bed!\"\nmsg = msg + \"\\n\" + date_message + \"\\n\" + time_message\nsnaps.display_message(msg, size=50)\ntime.sleep(10)  # leave time for the sound and to read\nMost of the text simply exists to correctly create the final message we will display on the screen. The most important parts are, is_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5 which uses the fact that Saturday and Sunday have the value \\(5\\) and \\(6\\) in the current_time.tm_wday attribute (A number representing the day in the week) to set a boolean flag. We then use the fact that True acts numerically as one, and False acts numerically as zero to let us sleep in an hour on the weekend using up_hour = 7 + is_weekend which is \\(8\\) on weekends and \\(7\\) on weekdays.\nWe then run through the code as we have for most of the alarm clock cases, using an else clause to ensure we always have a message for the user, and appending the date and time message to this output.\nLastly we pass the method to snaps for display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this next section we’ll write our first semi-sophisticated program\n\n\nScenario:\nA local theme park wants you to write a program that will let users check if they meet the age requirements to go on a ride. They provide the following table covering the current rides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRide\nRestrictions\n\n\n\n\nScenic River Cruise\nNone\n\n\nCarnival Carousel\nAt least 3 years old\n\n\nJungle Adventure Water Splash\nAt least 6 years old\n\n\nDownhill Mountain Run\nAt least 12 years old\n\n\nThe Regurgitator\nAt least 12 years old and less than 70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use a simple text interface\n\nWelcome to our Theme Park\n\nThese are the available rides\n\n1.

Ultimately the Customer is the one paying and so they should be involved in the UI design throughout!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a UI design, now we need to implement it\nOur code starts as below,\n\n# Example 5.10: Ride Selector Start\n# The basic shell of the Ride Selector UI\n\nprint(\"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n      These are the available ride:\n\n      1.

The rough structure is,\nselect ride\nif age of user is greater than or equal to the rides min age\n    Inform the user they can go on the ride\nelse:\n    Inform the user they cannot go on the ride\nProgrammers typically don’t like to repeat themselves as it increases the number of ways a program can go wrong. So ideally we would like a way were we could write something like the above once and have the appropriate checks be carried out, and the message printed without having to write it out for every case. We’ll look at some ways to do this later in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last ride introduces an additional check, we have a minimum and a maximum age.\n\nNeed to introduce another layer nested conditional to differentiate between the too old and too young case\n\n\n    if ride_number == 5:\n        print(\"You have selected The Regurgitator\")\n        if age &gt;= 12:\n            # first check age not too low\n            if age &gt; 70:\n                # Age is too old\n                print(\"Sorry, you are too old\")\n            else:\n                # In the valid range\n                print(\"You can go on the ride\")\n        else:\n            # Age is too young\n            print(\"Sorry, you are too young\")\n\nYou can see the final Program (Ride Selector)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add some extra quality to our implementation using snaps\nsnaps get_string method\n\n# Example 5.11: Snaps get_string function\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nname = snaps.get_string(\"Enter your name: \")\nsnaps.display_message(\"Hello \" + name)\ntime.sleep(5) #so there is time to read the message\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs written, the snaps get_string method on my machine, did not work when running Pygame 2. I had to modify the method to the following,\ndef get_string(prompt, size=50, margin=20,\n               color=(255, 0, 0), horiz='left', vert='center',\n               max_line_length=20):\n    '''\n    Reads a string from the user\n    '''\n\n    setup()\n\n    result = ''\n    cursor_char = '*'\n    cursor = None\n\n    def redraw():\n        clear_display()\n\n        render_message(prompt+result, margin=margin, size=size,\n                       horiz=horiz, vert=vert, color=color, cursor=cursor)\n\n    def cursor_flip():\n        nonlocal cursor\n\n    # create a timer for the cursor\n\n    cursor_event = pygame.USEREVENT+1\n\n    pygame.time.set_timer(cursor_event,500)\n    pygame.key.start_text_input()\n\n    while True:\n        event = pygame.event.wait()\n\n        if event.type == cursor_event:\n            if cursor:\n                cursor = None\n            else:\n                cursor = cursor_char\n            redraw()\n        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n            if event.key == pygame.K_RETURN:\n                break\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_BACKSPACE:\n                if len(result) &gt; 0:\n                    result = result[:-1]\n                    redraw()\n        elif event.type == pygame.TEXTINPUT:\n            if len(result) &lt; max_line_length:\n                result += event.text\n                redraw()\n\n    # disable the timer for the cursor\n    pygame.time.set_timer(cursor_event,0)\n    return result\nI won’t go into detail on explaining the changes since it’s above the level we’ve currently been discussing but if you have issues with the running any of the snaps get_string programs in this book, I would recommend trying the above replacement to the function\n\n\n\nUsing the above and some optional arguments to play around with text placement we can create the start of a GUI implementation of the Ride Selector Program\n\n\n\nThe below program is the outline for an implementation of the Ride Selector Program using snaps to provide a GUI\n# Example 5.12: Theme Park Snaps Display\n# Reimplments the shell of the Ride Selector Menu using Snaps\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\n\nsnaps.display_image(\"themepark.png\")\n\nprompt = \"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n      These are the available ride:\n\n      1.

Extending its features where reasonable\nWe’ll reimplement all the features of the original text-based interface, but add in the siren sound effect if the user is unable to ride the ride. Otherwise this proceeds as with most of our conversions to snaps. We replace print with snaps.display_message and introduce some work to build the string that we want to send to snaps.display_message. In this case we create a string that is nicely formatted to output\n\nThe ride number the user selected\nThe name of the ride\nA message letting them know if they are allowed to ride\n\nOur final implementation can be found in the file ThemeParkSnapsDisplay.py, or read from down below, observe the usual use of the time.sleep function to prevent the window from immediately closing\n# Exercise 5.3: Snaps Ride Selector\n# Reimplments the entirety of the Theme Park Ride Selector using\n# a snaps interface, and adds some audio ques to warn the user\n# when they are ineligable for ride\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\n\nsnaps.display_image(\"themepark.png\")\n\nprompt = \"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n      These are the available ride:\n\n      1.

This requires us to do the usual work of building the string before we display it. Next we also want to display an image, either a sun or a snowflake depending on if the weather is hot or cold. Since we’re grabbing some new images, we run into an issue that snaps doesn’t work to rescale the images out of the box. We can fix this by adding the line image = image.convert_alpha() before the image = pygame.transform.smoothscale(image, window_size) line in display_image in snaps. Our final program (Weather Helper) looks like,\n# Exercise 5.4 Weather Helper\n# Simple Weather Program that reminds the user about\n# the weather conditions, with helpful text and\n# pictures\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\ntemp = snaps.get_weather_temp(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)\nconditions = snaps.get_weather_desciption(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)\n\nif temp is None or conditions is None:\n    msg = \"Could not retrieve Weather...\"\nelse:\n    msg = \"The temperature is: \" + str(temp)\n    if temp &lt; 40:\n        msg = msg + \"\\n\\nWear a coat - it is cold out there\"\n        snaps.display_image(\"snowflake.png\")\n    elif temp &gt; 70:\n        msg = msg + \"\\n\\nRemember to wear sunscreen\"\n        snaps.display_image(\"sun.png\")\n    msg = msg + \"\\n\\nThe weather is \" + conditions\n\nsnaps.display_message(msg, size=100, color=\"red\")\ntime.sleep(5)\nIgnore the line if temp is None or conditions is None, this is some error handling code we’ll look at in a latter chapter. Notice that since no matter which path we go through the if, elif chain we’ll post a message at the end. So we use the branch code in order to set up the appropriate message, while the call to display_message sits outside the loop, so we don’t have to call it on every path.\n\n\n\nUsing randint and if statements write a fortune teller program that gives random fortunes to the user\nWe’ll expand on the prototype given by providing two additional statements, one relating to the future and the other relating to the wealth. We’ll follow the structure of using random.randint(1, 6) to simulate rolling a six-sided die, but spice it up by using if-elif-else clauses to play with the relative weighting of different statements.\n\n# Exercise 5.5\n# Fortune Teller Program\n#\n# A simple program that uses random numbers to generate a sequence of\n# fortunes for the user\n\nimport random\n\n# Meeting someone\nif random.randint(1, 6) &lt; 4:\n    print(\"You will meet a tall, dark stranger\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Nobody unexpected will enter your life\")\n\n# Money\nresult = random.randint(1, 6)\nif result == 1:\n    print(\"I see untold riches in your future\")\nelif result &lt;= 3:\n    print(\"A life of comfort is coming\")\nelif result &lt; 6:\n    print(\"You would do well to husband your wealth\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I see a future lived on the streets...\")\n\n# Advice\nresult = random.randint(1, 6)\nif result &lt;= 2:\n    print(\"Sometimes the answers to our future, come from the past\")\nelif result &lt; 6:\n    print(\"To define your future, avoid getting hung up on the past\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You will soon face a decision that will redefine everything\")\n\nNobody unexpected will enter your life\nA life of comfort is coming\nSometimes the answers to our future, come from the past\n\n\nWe use a mix of ==, &lt;= and &lt; operators to emphasise the clarity of the branching. This implementation is quite simple (because the exercise does not personally interest me that much) Feel free to expand on my solution",

    "text": "Caution\n\n\n\nA number of the code examples in this use the file siren.wav, this can be found in the corresponding chapter in the samples submodule. For space reasons we haven’t uploaded it to the github\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean values are a type that is used to distinguish between values that are True or False\nFor example, we could use an int to count the number of hairs on a person’s head, but a bool to indicate if they are bald\n\n\n\n\nSimply declare a variable with a value of True or False\n\nPython will infer the type\n\nFor example, to declare a true valued boolean,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = True\n\nwe can then set the value to false,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = False\n\nNote that True and False are python keywords, and are case-sensitive, e.g. true and false will not work as expected\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the python interpreter and work through the following questions to understand booleans\n\n*What do you think would happen if you printed the contents of a boolean value?\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = True\nprint(it_is_time_to_get_up)\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nPython will try to print out something meaningful, for a boolean this is either True or False\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you gave the word True to the input function?\nx = input(\"True or False: \")\nTrue or False: True\n\ninput returns it’s input as a string, so in this case x will not be a bool but rather a string with the value 'True'\n\nIs there a python function called bool that will convert things into Boolean, just like there are int and float functions?\n\nYes there is, consistent behaviour with bool. Consider the following examples\n\n\nprint(bool(1))\nprint(bool(0))\nprint(bool(0.0))\nprint(bool(0.1))\nprint(bool(''))\nprint(bool('Hello'))\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\nWe can see that non-zero numbers evaluate True while zero, evaluates as False. Similarly the empty string evaluates False while a non-empty string evaluates as True\n\nWhat happens if a program combines bool values with other values?\n\nWe should already expect that if we try to mix incompatible data that an error should be generated\n\n\n 'Hello' + True\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[3], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'Hello' + True\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"bool\") to str\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that we cannot concatenate a boolean value to a string\nThe behaviour can be a little less intuitive with numbers though,\n\n\n1 + True\n\n2\n\n\n\nTrue is implicitly converted to the integer value \\(1\\)\n\n\n1 + False\n\n1\n\n\n\nSimilarly, False is implicitly converted to the intger value \\(0\\)\nWe can see that numeric operations on bool thus have well-allowed behaviour but we cannot do the same with textual data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally we don’t declare a boolean with True or False explicitly but instead as the result of evaluating an expression\n\nSome expressions evaluate to True or False which naturally suits being stored in a boolean\n\nConsider a simple alarm clock,\n\nWe can get the time through the time library we’ve seen before\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\n\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\ntime.localtime returns an object containing information about the current time.\n\nThis different blocks of information are called attributes, below is a list of the attributes contained in the object returned by localtime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nValue\n\n\n\n\ntm_year\nYear (for example, 2017)\n\n\ntm_mon\nMonth (in the range 1 … 12, 1 represents January)\n\n\ntm_mday\nDay in the Month (in the range 1 … month length)\n\n\ntm_hour\nHour in the Day (in the range 0 … 23)\n\n\ntm_min\nMinute in the Hour ( in the range 0 … 59)\n\n\ntm_sec\nSeconds in the Minute ( in the range 0 … 59)\n\n\ntm_wday\nDay of the Week (in the range 0 … 6 with Monday as 0)\n\n\ntm_yday\nDay in the Year (in the range 0 … 364 or 365 depending on if the year is a leap year)\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a localtime object might look like,\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nValue\n\n\n\n\ntm_year\n2017\n\n\ntm_mon\n7\n\n\ntm_mday\n19\n\n\ntm_hour\n11\n\n\ntm_min\n40\n\n\ntm_sec\n30\n\n\ntm_wday\n2\n\n\ntm_yday\n200\n\n\n\n\n\nLets make a clock that displays only the hour value, using localtime. These one-handed clocks are supposed promote a more relaxed attitude.

For example, the \\(&gt;\\) and \\(&lt;\\) operators when used to compare strings will use an alphabetic ordering, e.g.\n\n'Alice' &lt; 'Brian'\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 4 we noted that floating points only approximate a specific real-value. These approximations can cause issues when using comparison operators, e.g.\n\nx = 0.3\ny = 0.1 + 0.2\nx == y\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nThe variables x and y should both notionally store \\(0.3\\), but the equality shows they are unequal. This is because the addition of \\(0.1\\) and \\(0.2\\) actually leads to y storing the slightly inaccurate \\(0.3000...4\\)\nIf comparing floating-point numbers for equality, the best approach is to check that the values are appropriately close\n\n\n\n\nPython provides the type function, type(x) returns the type of the variable x, especially useful for investigating the type of values returned by library functions you’ve never seen before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want to combine boolean expressions to create a new boolean expression\ne.g. An alarm might want to go off when the hour is after \\(7\\) and the minute is after \\(30\\)\nPython provides logic operators for combining boolean expressions\n\n\n\nUse the python interpreter to answer the following questions and investigate boolean operators\n\nWhat does the following expression evaluate too?\n\nnot True\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nnot inverts the value of a boolean, so True is converted to False\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue and True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nand is True iff both arguments are True as is the case above, so the result is True\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue and False\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nSince one of the arguments is False and will evaluate to False\n\nHow about this expression?\n\nTrue or False\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nSince one of the arguments is True or will evaluate to* True\n\nSo far, the examples have only used boolean values. What happens if we mix boolean and numeric values?\n\nTrue and 1\n\n1\n\n\n\nRecall that python can convert numeric expressions to boolean ones, this implicitly happens to the \\(1\\) in the above. So we would expect and to return True. However ,instead \\(1\\) is returned. This is due to some odd python behaviour\n\nPython sees True -&gt; result of and implied by second argument\n\nSo simply returns the second argument, since the truthfulness of \\(1\\), is equivalent to the original expression\n\nIf we flip the arguments, we should see this more clearly\n\n1 and True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nThis time the above expressions should return True\n\nThe same behaviour will also occur with or\n\n1 or False\n\n1\n\n\n\nHere the or operator short-circuits on \\(1\\), so returns \\(1\\)\n\n\n0 or True\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nHere the or evaluates the first argument as false, so cannot short-circuit, the second argument is returned, i.e True\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now use and to try construct an expression that will correctly evaluate when the time is after \\(7:30\\), naively we might expect,\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = hour &gt; 6 and minute &gt; 29\n\nWe can use a truth table to check,\n\n\n\n\nHour\nMinute\nDesired\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n6\n0\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n7\n29\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n7\n30\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n8\n0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in the last case the result is not what we want!\n\nhour &gt; 7 is true, but minute &gt; 29 is false, so we need to be more precise,\n\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29)\n\nWe use brackets to make the expression more readable\nHere we use short-circuiting, if the the hour is greater than \\(7\\) we don’t need to check the minutes value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen working with boolean operations you should always check that the logic matches what you expect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want a program to tell me if it’s time to get out of bed\nNeed the ability to run code if a boolean condition is met\n\nCan do so using the aptly named if operator\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new python program (SimpleAlarmClock.py) with the following contents\n\n\n# Example 5.2: Simple Alarm Clock\n# Demonstrates `if` using a simple alarm clock\n\nimport time\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_sec\n\nit_is_time_to_get_up = (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minute &gt; 29)\n\nif it_is_time_to_get_up:\n    print(\"IT IS TIME TO GET UP\")\n\nIT IS TIME TO GET UP\n\n\n\nThe program should print IT IS TIME TO GET UP only if the time is after \\(7:30\\)\nThe if construct starts with the word if, following by a boolean value called the condition, then a :\nAny statements we want to execute if the if is True are then written below the if and indented one level\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition is a term for the expression that controls which branch of the if is executed\nIf the condition evaluates True the indented branch is run\nIf the condition evluates False the indented branch is skipped\nWe could simply the above code by including the check directly in the if rather than an intermediate variable\n\n\nif (hour &gt; 7) or (hour == 7 and minutes &gt; 29):\n    print(\"IT IS TIME TO GET UP\")\n\nIT IS TIME TO GET UP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want multiple statements to run after an if statement\nWe just write them as a sequence of indented statements\n\n\n\nLet us improve the previous example to also play a sound if it’s time to get up.

What is a potential issue with this program?\n# Example 5.6: Broken Greeter\n# A Greeter program using string matching\n# Identify the issues with this program\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name == \"Rob\":\n    print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\nThe equality operator checks against the string \"Rob\" exactly, i.e. it is case sensitive, if we write \"ROB\", or \"rob\" or some variation thereof, the statement will not match.\nWe can fix this by using the string method upper, this converts all forms of the word \"rob\" to \"ROB\" which we can reliably check against. The new program looks like\n# Example 5.7: Uppercase Greeter\n# A Greeter program using string matching\n# Fixes the issues with Example 5.6 by using\n# str.upper()\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name.upper() == \"ROB\":\n    print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\n\nWe could also use the string method lower to compare against an all lowercase word\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions to learn about methods and functions\n\nHow do lower() and upper() work?\n\nPython types are objects that provide methods.\nMethods are called like functions\n\nWhy do we have to write lower() and not lower?\n\nLeave the parentheses off, and see what happens\n\n  name = 'Rob'\n  name.upper\n\n&lt;function str.upper()&gt;\n\n\nWe are instead returned a description of the method itself\n\nWhat’s the difference between functions and methods?\n\nThey are used the same way, but they differ in where they are created\nFunctions are not associated any specific object\nMethods are bound as attributes of objects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can nest conditions, e.g. if you want to perform sequential checks\n\n\n\nLet us demonstrate nested if through a greeter which requires a follow on code word to confirm the identity of the user. Create a program (CodedGreeter.py) with the following contents\n# Example 5.8: Coded Greeter\n# Asks the user for a follow on code to confirm their ID\n# before the program greets them\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nif name.upper() == \"ROB\":\n    code = input(\"Enter the codeword: \")\n    if code == \"secret\":\n        print(\"Hello, Oh great one\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Begone. Imposter\")\n\nPlay around with the above code to see what happens for various input combinations. You should see if the first input is not a variant of \"rob\" the second prompt never occurs and the program ends. Adjust the above by writing a new program (CodedGreeterWithOuterElse.py)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove the Alarm Clock. Make the alarm display the date as well as the time, and let the user sleep in on the weekends.\nOur implementation is given below,\n# Exercise 4.2: Advanced Alarm Clock\n# An Advanced Alarm Combining the Behaviour\n# of most increments of the alarm clock\n# and allowing you to sleep in on weekends\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\ncurrent_time = time.localtime()\nhour = current_time.tm_hour\nminute = current_time.tm_min\nday = current_time.tm_mday\nmonth = current_time.tm_mon\nis_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5\n\ndate_message = \"The date is \" + str(day) + \"/\" + str(month)\ntime_message = \"The time is \" + str(hour) + \":\" + str(minute)\n\nmsg = \"\"\nup_hour = 7 + is_weekend  # get to sleep in an extra hour on weekends\n\nif (hour &gt; up_hour) or (hour == up_hour and minute &gt; 29):\n    msg = msg + \"TIME TO GET UP\"\n    snaps.play_sound(\"siren.wav\")\nelse:\n    msg = msg + \"Go back to bed!\"\nmsg = msg + \"\\n\" + date_message + \"\\n\" + time_message\nsnaps.display_message(msg, size=50)\ntime.sleep(10)  # leave time for the sound and to read\nMost of the text simply exists to correctly create the final message we will display on the screen. The most important parts are, is_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5 which uses the fact that Saturday and Sunday have the value \\(5\\) and \\(6\\) in the current_time.tm_wday attribute (A number representing the day in the week) to set a boolean flag. We then use the fact that True acts numerically as one, and False acts numerically as zero to let us sleep in an hour on the weekend using up_hour = 7 + is_weekend which is \\(8\\) on weekends and \\(7\\) on weekdays.\nWe then run through the code as we have for most of the alarm clock cases, using an else clause to ensure we always have a message for the user, and appending the date and time message to this output.\nLastly we pass the method to snaps for display\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this next section we’ll write our first semi-sophisticated program\n\n\nScenario:\nA local theme park wants you to write a program that will let users check if they meet the age requirements to go on a ride.

So ideally we would like a way were we could write something like the above once and have the appropriate checks be carried out, and the message printed without having to write it out for every case. We’ll look at some ways to do this later in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last ride introduces an additional check, we have a minimum and a maximum age.\n\nNeed to introduce another layer nested conditional to differentiate between the too old and too young case\n\n\n    if ride_number == 5:\n        print(\"You have selected The Regurgitator\")\n        if age &gt;= 12:\n            # first check age not too low\n            if age &gt; 70:\n                # Age is too old\n                print(\"Sorry, you are too old\")\n            else:\n                # In the valid range\n                print(\"You can go on the ride\")\n        else:\n            # Age is too young\n            print(\"Sorry, you are too young\")\n\nYou can see the final Program (Ride Selector)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add some extra quality to our implementation using snaps\nsnaps get_string method\n\n# Example 5.11: Snaps get_string function\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nname = snaps.get_string(\"Enter your name: \")\nsnaps.display_message(\"Hello \" + name)\ntime.sleep(5) #so there is time to read the message\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs written, the snaps get_string method on my machine, did not work when running Pygame 2. I had to modify the method to the following,\ndef get_string(prompt, size=50, margin=20,\n               color=(255, 0, 0), horiz='left', vert='center',\n               max_line_length=20):\n    '''\n    Reads a string from the user\n    '''\n\n    setup()\n\n    result = ''\n    cursor_char = '*'\n    cursor = None\n\n    def redraw():\n        clear_display()\n\n        render_message(prompt+result, margin=margin, size=size,\n                       horiz=horiz, vert=vert, color=color, cursor=cursor)\n\n    def cursor_flip():\n        nonlocal cursor\n\n    # create a timer for the cursor\n\n    cursor_event = pygame.USEREVENT+1\n\n    pygame.time.set_timer(cursor_event,500)\n    pygame.key.start_text_input()\n\n    while True:\n        event = pygame.event.wait()\n\n        if event.type == cursor_event:\n            if cursor:\n                cursor = None\n            else:\n                cursor = cursor_char\n            redraw()\n        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n            if event.key == pygame.K_RETURN:\n                break\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_BACKSPACE:\n                if len(result) &gt; 0:\n                    result = result[:-1]\n                    redraw()\n        elif event.type == pygame.TEXTINPUT:\n            if len(result) &lt; max_line_length:\n                result += event.text\n                redraw()\n\n    # disable the timer for the cursor\n    pygame.time.set_timer(cursor_event,0)\n    return result\nI won’t go into detail on explaining the changes since it’s above the level we’ve currently been discussing but if you have issues with the running any of the snaps get_string programs in this book, I would recommend trying the above replacement to the function\n\n\n\nUsing the above and some optional arguments to play around with text placement we can create the start of a GUI implementation of the Ride Selector Program\n\n\n\nThe below program is the outline for an implementation of the Ride Selector Program using snaps to provide a GUI\n# Example 5.12: Theme Park Snaps Display\n# Reimplments the shell of the Ride Selector Menu using Snaps\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\n\nsnaps.display_image(\"themepark.png\")\n\nprompt = \"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n      These are the available ride:\n\n      1. Scenic River Cruise\n      2. Carnival Carousel\n      3. Jungle Adventure Water Splash\n      4. Downhill Mountain Run\n      5. The Regurgitator\n\n      Select your ride: \"\"\"\n\nride_number_text = snaps.get_string(prompt, vert=\"bottom\", max_line_length=3)\nconfirm = \"Ride \" + ride_number_text\n\nsnaps.display_message(confirm)\ntime.sleep(5) #gives user time to read the output\n\n\n\nUsing the previous example, complete the ride selector program. Extending its features where reasonable\nWe’ll reimplement all the features of the original text-based interface, but add in the siren sound effect if the user is unable to ride the ride. Otherwise this proceeds as with most of our conversions to snaps. We replace print with snaps.display_message and introduce some work to build the string that we want to send to snaps.display_message. In this case we create a string that is nicely formatted to output\n\nThe ride number the user selected\nThe name of the ride\nA message letting them know if they are allowed to ride\n\nOur final implementation can be found in the file ThemeParkSnapsDisplay.py, or read from down below, observe the usual use of the time.sleep function to prevent the window from immediately closing\n# Exercise 5.3: Snaps Ride Selector\n# Reimplments the entirety of the Theme Park Ride Selector using\n# a snaps interface, and adds some audio ques to warn the user\n# when they are ineligable for ride\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\n\nsnaps.display_image(\"themepark.png\")\n\nprompt = \"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n      These are the available ride:\n\n      1.

This requires us to do the usual work of building the string before we display it. Next we also want to display an image, either a sun or a snowflake depending on if the weather is hot or cold. Since we’re grabbing some new images, we run into an issue that snaps doesn’t work to rescale the images out of the box. We can fix this by adding the line image = image.convert_alpha() before the image = pygame.transform.smoothscale(image, window_size) line in display_image in snaps. Our final program (Weather Helper) looks like,\n# Exercise 5.4 Weather Helper\n# Simple Weather Program that reminds the user about\n# the weather conditions, with helpful text and\n# pictures\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\ntemp = snaps.get_weather_temp(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)\nconditions = snaps.get_weather_desciption(latitude=47.61, longitude=-122.33)\n\nif temp is None or conditions is None:\n    msg = \"Could not retrieve Weather...\"\nelse:\n    msg = \"The temperature is: \" + str(temp)\n    if temp &lt; 40:\n        msg = msg + \"\\n\\nWear a coat - it is cold out there\"\n        snaps.display_image(\"snowflake.png\")\n    elif temp &gt; 70:\n        msg = msg + \"\\n\\nRemember to wear sunscreen\"\n        snaps.display_image(\"sun.png\")\n    msg = msg + \"\\n\\nThe weather is \" + conditions\n\nsnaps.display_message(msg, size=100, color=\"red\")\ntime.sleep(5)\nIgnore the line if temp is None or conditions is None, this is some error handling code we’ll look at in a latter chapter. Notice that since no matter which path we go through the if, elif chain we’ll post a message at the end. So we use the branch code in order to set up the appropriate message, while the call to display_message sits outside the loop, so we don’t have to call it on every path.\n\n\n\nUsing randint and if statements write a fortune teller program that gives random fortunes to the user\nWe’ll expand on the prototype given by providing two additional statements, one relating to the future and the other relating to the wealth. We’ll follow the structure of using random.randint(1, 6) to simulate rolling a six-sided die, but spice it up by using if-elif-else clauses to play with the relative weighting of different statements.\n\n# Exercise 5.5\n# Fortune Teller Program\n#\n# A simple program that uses random numbers to generate a sequence of\n# fortunes for the user\n\nimport random\n\n# Meeting someone\nif random.randint(1, 6) &lt; 4:\n    print(\"You will meet a tall, dark stranger\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Nobody unexpected will enter your life\")\n\n# Money\nresult = random.randint(1, 6)\nif result == 1:\n    print(\"I see untold riches in your future\")\nelif result &lt;= 3:\n    print(\"A life of comfort is coming\")\nelif result &lt; 6:\n    print(\"You would do well to husband your wealth\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I see a future lived on the streets...\")\n\n# Advice\nresult = random.randint(1, 6)\nif result &lt;= 2:\n    print(\"Sometimes the answers to our future, come from the past\")\nelif result &lt; 6:\n    print(\"To define your future, avoid getting hung up on the past\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You will soon face a decision that will redefine everything\")\n\nNobody unexpected will enter your life\nA life of comfort is coming\nSometimes the answers to our future, come from the past\n\n\nWe use a mix of ==, &lt;= and &lt; operators to emphasise the clarity of the branching. This implementation is quite simple (because the exercise does not personally interest me that much) Feel free to expand on my solution",

Formally verifing anything but the most trivial program as being correct is very difficult (and the problem in general is not-computable (see The Halting Problem))\nIt is typically the responsibility of the programmer to to ensure a program behaves correctly (in conjuction with the customer.) Even in cases where a user inputs wrong data, the customer would probably expect the programmer to build into the program the appropriate checks to deal with these wrong data inputs\n\nIs there a limit to how many if conditions you can nest inside each other?\n\nNo, the python interpreter should be able to handle many many layers of nested if statements. Most people will emphasise that if you’re finding that you’re needing to write heavily nested code (the exact number of what constitutes heavy is debated but \\(3\\) is a rough guide) you should look at if there’s a better way to write",

Any text editor should do.\n\n\n\nOpen a text editor and enter the following into the file,\n2+2\nSave the file somewhere appropriate with a name and the .py extension. Then run the program, if you have IDLE you can run it through that. I personally use the command line as\npython path-to-file\nYou may need to use python3 or python3.X depending on how your environment is setup where X is the python subversion. The code should execute but produce no output.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the example produce an empty output when run as a program, but \\(4\\) when run through the interpreter?\n\nProgram returns \\(4\\) to the caller, which for the program, is the shell that executes it\nWhat we really want is to output to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: Python Data Processing with I/O\nconfig:\n  flowchart:\n    htmlLabels: false\n---\nflowchart LR\n\ninput((\"Python\n        Commands\"))\ncomputer[\"Python Command Shell\"]\noutput((\"Results\"))\nuser[\"User\"]\n\ninput--&gt;computer\ncomputer--&gt;output\nuser &lt;--&gt; computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want the program to be able to interact with the user to provide output, and request input\n\nThe first such function we need is print\n\n\n\n\nWrite a python file (using_print.py) with the following contents\n\nprint(2+2)\n\n4\n\n\nNow run the program. It should produce the same output as above (\\(4\\)). On my machine, running the following in terminal, leads to the output \\(4\\) as expected\nuv run using_print.py\n4\nNow create a new file (using_print2.py) with the following contents\n\nprint('The answer is: ')\nprint(2 + 2)\n\nThe answer is: \n4\n\n\nSave and run this file. The output should match the above\nObserve here that the program automatically adds a new line, if we want to avoid that we can instead write\n\nprint('The answer is:', 2+2)\n\nThe answer is: 4\n\n\nWrite and run a new file (using_print3.py) containing the above line and check the output matches the above.\nHere we see that one of the ways to call print is to provide a comma seperated list of values. By default print adds a space between these elements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere are several ways a python program can fail, for example\n\nprint('The answer is: '}\n\n\n  Cell In[4], line 1\n    print('The answer is: '}\n                           ^\nSyntaxError: closing parenthesis '}' does not match opening parenthesis '('\n\n\n\n\nleads to a syntax error, because the wrong parentheses have been used. Or,\n\nPrint(2 + 2)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[5], line 1\n----&gt; 1 Print(2 + 2)\n\nNameError: name 'Print' is not defined\n\n\n\nleads to a NameError because function names are case sensitive, and we have put Print not print. Proper use of tooling can catch these syntax and other errors before you run the code, however sometimes errors slip through and you end up with errors occuring at run time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries provide additional built in functions, like ord and chr already seen\nLibraries can be supplied built-in, i.e. supplied with the python install, or installed later\n\n\n\n\nProvides a source of random numbers\nTo add a library we use the import command, e.g. import random\n\ni.e. import then the name of the library\n\nWe can then use functions from the library with the format, module_name.function_name(arguments)\n\ne.g. for random we can use randint as random.randint(1,6) to generate a random number from \\(1\\) to \\(6\\)\n\n\n\n\nWrite and run a python program containing the following lines\n\nimport random\nprint('You have rolled:', random.randint(1,6))\n\nYou have rolled: 5\n\n\nTry running this program multiple times and see what the output is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf we try calling random.randint without importing random we will get a NameError since neither random or randint will be recognised by the interpreter.\nIf we get the name of the module wrong, e.g. import Random, then we should get a ModuleNotFoundError\n\n\n\nThe python shell and most modern text editors can access documentation about pythons functions to help you with using them, typically by hovering over the function name. Try this in your setup, in mine I get the documentation:\n\ndef randint(a : int, b : int) -&gt; int\nReturn random integer in range [a,b], including both end points\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time function contains functions for managing dates and times\nThe sleep function lets a program for a given time period\n\nTells the operating system to pause execution of the program for a set time period\nOther programs continue running as normal\n\n\n\n\nWrite an execute the following program\n\nimport time\nprint('I will need to think about that...')\ntime.sleep(5)\nprint('The answer is: 42')\n\nI will need to think about that...\nThe answer is: 42\n\n\nYou should see the program print the first line, pause for about \\(5\\) seconds, then print the second line. The above shell should show the code after all lines have run\n\n\nMake an egg timer program. The program should allow the user to time a 5-minute boiled egg. You can do this by modifying the example sleep program which paused for \\(5\\) seconds. For extra style points, you could make the program print, “Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready,” \\(30\\) seconds before the \\(5\\)-minute deadline. You could even expand this into an interactive recipe program that describes the steps to be performed at each point in the recipe and then pauses until the next step is performed\nCurrently we haven’t been show a way to get input from the user so we can’t add that final step of interactivity. But the first two are fairly simple. There are \\(300\\) seconds in \\(5\\) minutes. So we want to tell the user to put the egg in, then sleep for \\(270\\) seconds, then print our message to get ready, sleep for another \\(30\\) seconds then tell the user to remove the egg.\nThe final code is then, (with sample output)\nimport time\n\nprint('Make sure the water is boiling!!!')\nprint('Drop the egg in...')\ntime.sleep(270)\nprint('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Egg cooked, remove now.')\n\n\nMake sure the water is boiling!!!\nDrop the egg in...\nNearly cooked, get your spoon ready\nEgg cooked, remove now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments are used to add metadata to code, i.e. extra information that does not impact how the code is run\ne.g. version numbers, authorship attribution, modification dates\nA comment is marked with a # and extends to the end of the line\n\n#Egg Timer program 1.0 by Rob Miles\nimport time\nprint('Put the egg in boiling water now!')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Take the egg out now')\n\nComments can be added at the end of statements, e.g.\n\ntime.sleep(300) #sleep while egg cooks (300 seconds or 5 minutes)\n\nThe above comment is good because it explains why the function is called\nA bad comment simply repeats the code\nComments have a maintainence overhead, you must keep them consistent with the surrounding code or they will generate confusion\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use sleep to delay the end of a program. This can be useful in some environments where the calling window automatically closes after the program finishes execution, sleep lets you actually see the output\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps is a library provided with the book code that provides simple functions for working with text, images and sound\nUses the pygame library\n\n\n\n\nPygame is a not packaged with python: we have to install it\nNormally this is done through a package manager, pip is a python package manager provided with python\nIn a terminal run one of the following lines,\n\npy -m pip install pygame --user #Windows\npython -m pip install pygame --user #Mac or Linux\n\nYou may need to use python3 instead of python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstalling python packages and python package management is a whole issue. In general one should prefer virtual environments, user installations to isolate packages to the specific project. A program that I use that assists with all of this is called uv. In uv a package is added with the command uv add package-name. Package management and uv is a complicated topic, but to get started look at their homepage which is quite well documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snaps library, is a python file contained in the provided book sample code, in each chapter folder with examples.\n\nIf you want to use snaps we could install it, but this is a bit more involved than where we are at right now\nInstead simply copy it into the same folder as any python file that wants to use it\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps contains a display_message function that takes a string of text and displays it on the screen\n\n\n\n\nThe first example uses the most basic form of display_message\n\n# Displaying Text via Snaps\n\nfrom snaps import *\nimport time\n\ndisplay_message('hello world')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nThe above creates a window with red text saying ‘Hello World’.\n\nWe’ve added the sleep so the window doesn’t automatically close - see discussion about Delaying the end of a program\n\nThe from snaps import * is an alternate import structure\n\nIt says’s from the module snaps import everything (*)\nThis means we don’t need to use the snaps prefix\nGenerally avoid doing this as it can mean that different packages with the same function names will cause naming clashes\n\nPython functions support optional arguments\n\nThese are arguments that have some default supplied value\nWe can customise these to change function behaviour\n\nThe second example uses these optional arguments to change the size, colour and alignment of the text\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('This is smaller text in green on the top left', color=(0, 255, 0), size=50, horiz='left', vert='top')\ntime.sleep(5) #so window doesn't immediately close\n\n\n\n\n\nLike display_message, the display_image function in snaps can be used to display an image file.\nFunction takes the path to the image and can be an png or jpeg\nText can be overlayed on an image by calling display_message after `display_image*\n\n\n\n\nHere we use display_image to render a jpeg, with some overlayed text\n\n#display an image using snaps library\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('Housemartins.jpg')\nsnaps.display_message('Hull Rocks', color=(255, 255, 255), vert='top')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain note, that sleep is used to prevent the window from closing\nThe order of the display messages matters, try changing the order and seeing the result\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have text and images, the last we need is sound, snaps has the play_sound function for this purpose\n\n\n\n\nHere we use play_sound to play a .wav audio file\n\n#play an audio file using snaps\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain, note we need to use sleep to prevent the program immediately ending, which will make it seem like the sound doesn’t play!\nIf you want to work with audio files, a commonly used program is Audacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the snaps program to add visuals and sound to some of the previous examples\n\n\n\nUse the snaps program to make an egg-timer\nOur implementation is a modification of Exercise 3.1, essentially replacing the print with snaps display_message\n# reimplements the Egg Timer Exercise using the snaps library\n# to add a visual and audio component\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('egg_timer_background.png')\nsnaps.display_message('Drop the egg in boiling water',\n                      color=(255, 0, 0), vert='top', size=100)\ntime.sleep(270)\nsnaps.display_message('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready!',\n                      color=(0, 0, 255), size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\nsnaps.display_message('Egg cooked, remove now.',\n                      color=(0, 255, 0), vert='bottom', size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\n\nWe first set the background using display_image\n\nThis means the text will appear over the top of the background image\n\nWe then display the initial message\n\nThis is displayed in red, at the top, we adjust the size of the text to \\(100\\) so the text fits on the window\n\nWe then sleep for the first \\(4.5\\) minutes\nWe then inform the user that there is \\(30\\) seconds to go, like in the original code.\n\nThis time the text is displayed in blue, and migrates to the middle of the screen\n\nWe then sleep again for the last \\(30\\) seconds\nFinally we first play a sound to alert the user\nWe then display the message that the egg is ready\n\nThis time at the bottom and in red\n\nWe then sleep for \\(30\\) seconds so the user has time to notice and hear the sound\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a high-low party game. The game works like this,\n\nThe program displays a number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) inclusive\nThe program then sleeps for \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is asleep, the players are invited to decide if the next number is higher or lower than the number just printed. Players who chose high stand on the right. Players who chose low stand on the left\nThe program then displays a second number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\), and anyone who was wrong is eliminated from the game. The program is then re-run with the players that are left until you have a winner\n\nFor fun we use snaps for our implementation to make this visual\n# High-Low\n# Implements the High-Low Party game\n# Generates a random number in the interval [1, 10]\n# Sleeps for a period of time\n# Shows another number\n# Players are asked to guess if this second number will be higher or lower\n\nimport snaps\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('The first number is...')\ntime.sleep(5) #sleep so people can read the first message\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(3) # leave time to read the number\nsnaps.display_message('Will the next be higher or lower?')\n\n# sleep for 20 seconds total, with a message to raise the tension with 5s left\ntime.sleep(15)\nsnaps.display_message('The second number is...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(10) # leave time for the players to read\n\nObserve that we have to wrap the display_message calls with calls to sleep to ensure that there is time for the user to read the messages\nThe output of (a terminal implementation of the program) should look something like,\n\n\n\nThe first number is:  6\nWill the next be higher or lower?\nThe second number is:  10\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a Nerves of Steel game. This game works like this\n\nThe program displays “Players Stand”\nThe program sleeps for a random time between \\(5\\) and \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is sleeping, players can sit down. Keep track of the last person to sit down\nThe program displays “Last to sit down wins.” Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down\n\n\nAgain for fun we’ll use snaps to make a basic window.\n\n# Nerves of Steel\n# Implements the Nerves of Steel Party Game\n# Players stand\n# Generates a random time interval\n# All players standing after the time interval expires lose\n# Last to sit down before the interval expires wins\n\nimport snaps\n\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('Players Stand')\ntime.sleep(random.randint(5, 20))\nsnaps.display_message('Last to sit down wins', color=(0, 255, 0))\n\ntime.sleep(5) #so program doesn't immediately end\n\nWe add a sleep at the end so the players have time to read the text. We also switch the final text from the initial red to green to celebrate the winner\nThe output of a terminal-based implementation might look like,\n\n\n\nPlayers Stand\nLast to sit down wins",

    "text": "A program is a sequence of actions performed in order\n\nA script is a type of program that often repeats a series of simple tasks\n\nPython programs are stored as text files, traditionally with a .py extension\n\n\n\n\nTo run a program, you first need to write it. Any text editor should do.\n\n\n\nOpen a text editor and enter the following into the file,\n2+2\nSave the file somewhere appropriate with a name and the .py extension. Then run the program, if you have IDLE you can run it through that. I personally use the command line as\npython path-to-file\nYou may need to use python3 or python3.X depending on how your environment is setup where X is the python subversion. The code should execute but produce no output.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the example produce an empty output when run as a program, but \\(4\\) when run through the interpreter?\n\nProgram returns \\(4\\) to the caller, which for the program, is the shell that executes it\nWhat we really want is to output to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: Python Data Processing with I/O\nconfig:\n  flowchart:\n    htmlLabels: false\n---\nflowchart LR\n\ninput((\"Python\n        Commands\"))\ncomputer[\"Python Command Shell\"]\noutput((\"Results\"))\nuser[\"User\"]\n\ninput--&gt;computer\ncomputer--&gt;output\nuser &lt;--&gt; computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want the program to be able to interact with the user to provide output, and request input\n\nThe first such function we need is print\n\n\n\n\nWrite a python file (using_print.py) with the following contents\n\nprint(2+2)\n\n4\n\n\nNow run the program. It should produce the same output as above (\\(4\\)). On my machine, running the following in terminal, leads to the output \\(4\\) as expected\nuv run using_print.py\n4\nNow create a new file (using_print2.py) with the following contents\n\nprint('The answer is: ')\nprint(2 + 2)\n\nThe answer is: \n4\n\n\nSave and run this file. The output should match the above\nObserve here that the program automatically adds a new line, if we want to avoid that we can instead write\n\nprint('The answer is:', 2+2)\n\nThe answer is: 4\n\n\nWrite and run a new file (using_print3.py) containing the above line and check the output matches the above.\nHere we see that one of the ways to call print is to provide a comma seperated list of values. By default print adds a space between these elements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThere are several ways a python program can fail, for example\n\nprint('The answer is: '}\n\n\n  Cell In[4], line 1\n    print('The answer is: '}\n                           ^\nSyntaxError: closing parenthesis '}' does not match opening parenthesis '('\n\n\n\n\nleads to a syntax error, because the wrong parentheses have been used. Or,\n\nPrint(2 + 2)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[5], line 1\n----&gt; 1 Print(2 + 2)\n\nNameError: name 'Print' is not defined\n\n\n\nleads to a NameError because function names are case sensitive, and we have put Print not print. Proper use of tooling can catch these syntax and other errors before you run the code, however sometimes errors slip through and you end up with errors occuring at run time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries provide additional built in functions, like ord and chr already seen\nLibraries can be supplied built-in, i.e. supplied with the python install, or installed later\n\n\n\n\nProvides a source of random numbers\nTo add a library we use the import command, e.g. import random\n\ni.e. import then the name of the library\n\nWe can then use functions from the library with the format, module_name.function_name(arguments)\n\ne.g. for random we can use randint as random.randint(1,6) to generate a random number from \\(1\\) to \\(6\\)\n\n\n\n\nWrite and run a python program containing the following lines\n\nimport random\nprint('You have rolled:', random.randint(1,6))\n\nYou have rolled: 5\n\n\nTry running this program multiple times and see what the output is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf we try calling random.randint without importing random we will get a NameError since neither random or randint will be recognised by the interpreter.\nIf we get the name of the module wrong, e.g. import Random, then we should get a ModuleNotFoundError\n\n\n\nThe python shell and most modern text editors can access documentation about pythons functions to help you with using them, typically by hovering over the function name. Try this in your setup, in mine I get the documentation:\n\ndef randint(a : int, b : int) -&gt; int\nReturn random integer in range [a,b], including both end points\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time function contains functions for managing dates and times\nThe sleep function lets a program for a given time period\n\nTells the operating system to pause execution of the program for a set time period\nOther programs continue running as normal\n\n\n\n\nWrite an execute the following program\n\nimport time\nprint('I will need to think about that...')\ntime.sleep(5)\nprint('The answer is: 42')\n\nI will need to think about that...\nThe answer is: 42\n\n\nYou should see the program print the first line, pause for about \\(5\\) seconds, then print the second line. The above shell should show the code after all lines have run\n\n\nMake an egg timer program. The program should allow the user to time a 5-minute boiled egg. You can do this by modifying the example sleep program which paused for \\(5\\) seconds. For extra style points, you could make the program print, “Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready,” \\(30\\) seconds before the \\(5\\)-minute deadline. You could even expand this into an interactive recipe program that describes the steps to be performed at each point in the recipe and then pauses until the next step is performed\nCurrently we haven’t been show a way to get input from the user so we can’t add that final step of interactivity. But the first two are fairly simple. There are \\(300\\) seconds in \\(5\\) minutes. So we want to tell the user to put the egg in, then sleep for \\(270\\) seconds, then print our message to get ready, sleep for another \\(30\\) seconds then tell the user to remove the egg.\nThe final code is then, (with sample output)\nimport time\n\nprint('Make sure the water is boiling!!!')\nprint('Drop the egg in...')\ntime.sleep(270)\nprint('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Egg cooked, remove now.')\n\n\nMake sure the water is boiling!!!\nDrop the egg in...\nNearly cooked, get your spoon ready\nEgg cooked, remove now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments are used to add metadata to code, i.e. extra information that does not impact how the code is run\ne.g. version numbers, authorship attribution, modification dates\nA comment is marked with a # and extends to the end of the line\n\n#Egg Timer program 1.0 by Rob Miles\nimport time\nprint('Put the egg in boiling water now!')\ntime.sleep(300)\nprint('Take the egg out now')\n\nComments can be added at the end of statements, e.g.\n\ntime.sleep(300) #sleep while egg cooks (300 seconds or 5 minutes)\n\nThe above comment is good because it explains why the function is called\nA bad comment simply repeats the code\nComments have a maintainence overhead, you must keep them consistent with the surrounding code or they will generate confusion\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use sleep to delay the end of a program. This can be useful in some environments where the calling window automatically closes after the program finishes execution, sleep lets you actually see the output\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps is a library provided with the book code that provides simple functions for working with text, images and sound\nUses the pygame library\n\n\n\n\nPygame is a not packaged with python: we have to install it\nNormally this is done through a package manager, pip is a python package manager provided with python\nIn a terminal run one of the following lines,\n\npy -m pip install pygame --user #Windows\npython -m pip install pygame --user #Mac or Linux\n\nYou may need to use python3 instead of python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstalling python packages and python package management is a whole issue. In general one should prefer virtual environments, user installations to isolate packages to the specific project. A program that I use that assists with all of this is called uv. In uv a package is added with the command uv add package-name. Package management and uv is a complicated topic, but to get started look at their homepage which is quite well documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snaps library, is a python file contained in the provided book sample code, in each chapter folder with examples.\n\nIf you want to use snaps we could install it, but this is a bit more involved than where we are at right now\nInstead simply copy it into the same folder as any python file that wants to use it\n\n\n\n\n\nsnaps contains a display_message function that takes a string of text and displays it on the screen\n\n\n\n\nThe first example uses the most basic form of display_message\n\n# Displaying Text via Snaps\n\nfrom snaps import *\nimport time\n\ndisplay_message('hello world')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nThe above creates a window with red text saying ‘Hello World’.\n\nWe’ve added the sleep so the window doesn’t automatically close - see discussion about Delaying the end of a program\n\nThe from snaps import * is an alternate import structure\n\nIt says’s from the module snaps import everything (*)\nThis means we don’t need to use the snaps prefix\nGenerally avoid doing this as it can mean that different packages with the same function names will cause naming clashes\n\nPython functions support optional arguments\n\nThese are arguments that have some default supplied value\nWe can customise these to change function behaviour\n\nThe second example uses these optional arguments to change the size, colour and alignment of the text\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('This is smaller text in green on the top left', color=(0, 255, 0), size=50, horiz='left', vert='top')\ntime.sleep(5) #so window doesn't immediately close\n\n\n\n\n\nLike display_message, the display_image function in snaps can be used to display an image file.\nFunction takes the path to the image and can be an png or jpeg\nText can be overlayed on an image by calling display_message after `display_image*\n\n\n\n\nHere we use display_image to render a jpeg, with some overlayed text\n\n#display an image using snaps library\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('Housemartins.jpg')\nsnaps.display_message('Hull Rocks', color=(255, 255, 255), vert='top')\n\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain note, that sleep is used to prevent the window from closing\nThe order of the display messages matters, try changing the order and seeing the result\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have text and images, the last we need is sound, snaps has the play_sound function for this purpose\n\n\n\n\nHere we use play_sound to play a .wav audio file\n\n#play an audio file using snaps\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nAgain, note we need to use sleep to prevent the program immediately ending, which will make it seem like the sound doesn’t play!\nIf you want to work with audio files, a commonly used program is Audacity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the snaps program to add visuals and sound to some of the previous examples\n\n\n\nUse the snaps program to make an egg-timer\nOur implementation is a modification of Exercise 3.1, essentially replacing the print with snaps display_message\n# reimplements the Egg Timer Exercise using the snaps library\n# to add a visual and audio component\n\nimport snaps\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_image('egg_timer_background.png')\nsnaps.display_message('Drop the egg in boiling water',\n                      color=(255, 0, 0), vert='top', size=100)\ntime.sleep(270)\nsnaps.display_message('Nearly cooked, get your spoon ready!',\n                      color=(0, 0, 255), size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\nsnaps.play_sound('ding.wav')\nsnaps.display_message('Egg cooked, remove now.',\n                      color=(0, 255, 0), vert='bottom', size=100)\ntime.sleep(30)\n\nWe first set the background using display_image\n\nThis means the text will appear over the top of the background image\n\nWe then display the initial message\n\nThis is displayed in red, at the top, we adjust the size of the text to \\(100\\) so the text fits on the window\n\nWe then sleep for the first \\(4.5\\) minutes\nWe then inform the user that there is \\(30\\) seconds to go, like in the original code.\n\nThis time the text is displayed in blue, and migrates to the middle of the screen\n\nWe then sleep again for the last \\(30\\) seconds\nFinally we first play a sound to alert the user\nWe then display the message that the egg is ready\n\nThis time at the bottom and in red\n\nWe then sleep for \\(30\\) seconds so the user has time to notice and hear the sound\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a high-low party game. The game works like this,\n\nThe program displays a number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) inclusive\nThe program then sleeps for \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is asleep, the players are invited to decide if the next number is higher or lower than the number just printed. Players who chose high stand on the right. Players who chose low stand on the left\nThe program then displays a second number between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\), and anyone who was wrong is eliminated from the game. The program is then re-run with the players that are left until you have a winner\n\nFor fun we use snaps for our implementation to make this visual\n# High-Low\n# Implements the High-Low Party game\n# Generates a random number in the interval [1, 10]\n# Sleeps for a period of time\n# Shows another number\n# Players are asked to guess if this second number will be higher or lower\n\nimport snaps\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('The first number is...')\ntime.sleep(5) #sleep so people can read the first message\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(3) # leave time to read the number\nsnaps.display_message('Will the next be higher or lower?')\n\n# sleep for 20 seconds total, with a message to raise the tension with 5s left\ntime.sleep(15)\nsnaps.display_message('The second number is...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\nsnaps.display_message(random.randint(1, 10))\ntime.sleep(10) # leave time for the players to read\n\nObserve that we have to wrap the display_message calls with calls to sleep to ensure that there is time for the user to read the messages\nThe output of (a terminal implementation of the program) should look something like,\n\n\n\nThe first number is:  6\nWill the next be higher or lower?\nThe second number is:  10\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the random number generator and sleep to make a Nerves of Steel game. This game works like this\n\nThe program displays “Players Stand”\nThe program sleeps for a random time between \\(5\\) and \\(20\\) seconds. While the program is sleeping, players can sit down. Keep track of the last person to sit down\nThe program displays “Last to sit down wins.” Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down\n\n\nAgain for fun we’ll use snaps to make a basic window.\n\n# Nerves of Steel\n# Implements the Nerves of Steel Party Game\n# Players stand\n# Generates a random time interval\n# All players standing after the time interval expires lose\n# Last to sit down before the interval expires wins\n\nimport snaps\n\nimport random\nimport time\n\nsnaps.display_message('Players Stand')\ntime.sleep(random.randint(5, 20))\nsnaps.display_message('Last to sit down wins', color=(0, 255, 0))\n\ntime.sleep(5) #so program doesn't immediately end\n\nWe add a sleep at the end so the players have time to read the text.

    "text": "Question and Answers\n\nWould a user ever use the Python Command Shell?\n\nThe command shell is very useful for programmers. Programmers can toy with code to check the output. Typically a user won’t interact with the shell but a program instead\n\nWhat would happen if two libraries contain a function with the same name?\n\nIf we use the import library approach nothing. Since functions are namespaced by their library we would simply have library1.function and library2.function\ne.g. we might have user.menu and system.menu\nIf we use the from library import * function then we might have an issue as the names will clash\n\nCan I make comments more than one line long?\n\nSeveral languages support multiline comments (e.g. Java, C, C#), these are comments that by default span multiple lines\nPython requires you to use multiple #, i.e. one for each line\n\nThis is referred to as only supporting single line comments\n\nLater we’ll see a syntax for adding multiline strings that can be used for documentation in a similar way to multiline comments\n\nCan a python program run on any computer?\n\nYes and No. If a computer has a python interpreter installed then code should be able to run on it. However, there are caveats, the computer might require the same version of python and any libraries used some of which may be hardware or software dependent, e.g. a library might be specifically written to utilise the Windows API\n\nIs the python language the same on every machine?\n\nAgain Yes and No. Every computer should have the same core language, however different computers may have different versions of the same language which have slightly different feature sets. In fact it is often common for the same computer to manage several different python versions in different virtual environments\nMore common is for different computers to rely on libraries, that may not be commonly shared and may rely on hardware or software specific features to run.\n\nCan I use Snaps in my program?\n\nYes, it is provided by the book author to be used",

Some are converted to low-level hardware instructions. This is called compilation, and in place of an interpreter it requires a compiler to convert the code. Compiled programs are typically faster, since they can be optimised\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers fundamentally represent data as \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) in binary\n\nWe build up layers of abstract that let us handle concepts like numbers, characters and strings of text\n\nData can be regarded as the stored values representing information\nInformation is thus the interpretation of data, to mean something\n\n\n\n\nPython scripts thus can be considered data processors\n\nThe script is interpreted and converted to output\n\n\n\n\nStart up the python interpreter and run the following\n\n'hello'\n\n 'hello'\n\n'hello'\n\n\n\nLike before with \\(2\\) the word is echoed.\n\n`‘hello’ + ’ world’\n\n 'hello' + 'world'\n\n'helloworld'\n\n\n\n“Adding” two words performs a string concatenation\nObserve we explicitly have to include the space character in one of the strings\nA cool observation is that + changes it’s behaviour in response to what it’s arguments are\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think would happen if missed the closing quote of a string you were typing?\n\nWe would expect it, to either hang waiting for the closing quote like with the missing left parenthesis, or a syntax error like a right quote.

We expect an error.\n\n\n 'hello' - ' world'\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[13], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' - ' world'\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n\n\n\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: ‘str’ and ‘str’\nThe error message is somewhat obtuse but simply means that for the operand (-) we can’t subtract a string from another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to add a number to a string?\n\nThis one can vary. There a two valid interpretations,\n\nYou can’t add a number to a word\nTreat the number as word, and concatenate it\n\nMost languages, use the former choice and so we make the assumption that python does too\n\n\n 'hello' + 2\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[14], line 1\n----&gt; 1 'hello' + 2\n\nTypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n\n\n\n\nThe result is as expected, the error tells we can only concatenate a string to another string\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you tried to multiply a string by a number?\n\nAgain there are two interpretations,\n\nYou can’t multiply a word by a number\nYou can consider word * 3 as adding word three lots of word, where adding is string concatenation\n\nLets see what choice python uses,\n\n\n 'hello' * 3\n\n'hellohellohello'\n\n\n\nThe moral?

    "text": "Variables let us add memory to python\n\nCan be viewed as an alias for a storage location\n\nVariables in python are created by defining a name, and providing a value, e.g. the below defines a variable total and assigns it the value \\(0\\)\n\n\ntotal = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 3\n    space\n    title[\"Anatomy of Variable Assignment\"]\n    space\n\n    block:variable\n    columns 1\n        varName[\"total\"]\n        variablebody[\"variable\"]\n        variableDescr[\"(thing to which value assigned)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:equals\n    columns 1\n        equalsSymbol[\"=\"]\n        equalsName[\"equals\"]\n        equalsDescr[\"(means assign)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:argumentblock\n    columns 1\n        zero[\"0\"]\n        zeroName[\"expression\"]\n        zeroDescr[\"(value to assign)\"]\n    end\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass variablebody BG\nclass variableDescr BG\nclass equalsName BG\nclass equalsDescr BG\nclass zeroName BG\nclass zeroDescr BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagramatically breaks down variable assignment. On the left we have the variable, then = which means assignment, followed by the expression to assign\nThe assignment expression does not need to be made of simple primitives, e.g. total = us_sales + world_wide_sales defines the variable total to be equal to the sum of the variables us_sales and world_wide_sales\n\n\n\nStart up a python interpreter, then run the following commands in sequence\n\ntotal = 0\n\n total = 0\n\n\nNo output is generated, the assignment is performed silently\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n0\n\n\n\n0 output\ntotal has been assigned 0, putting the variable name into the terminal returns the value associated with this value\n\ntotal = total + 10\n\n total = total + 10\n\n\nNo output\nLike with the first statement, variable assignment generates no output\nHere we assign total the value given by the current value of total plus \\(10\\)\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n10\n\n\n\n10 output\nThe new value of total is printed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables require names\nPython variable names must obey a number of rules\n\nMust start with a letter or _\nCan contain letters, numbers or _ characters\n\nSome valid names are\n\ntotal\nxyz -t0tal\n\nSome invalid names are\n\n2_be_or_not_to_be\n\nStarts with a number which is not allowed\n\ntot@l\n\n@ is not a valid character for a variable name\n\n\nPython names are case sensitive, i.e. FRED and fred are distinct variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCreate Meaningful Names\nDon’t use silly or meaningless names like hello_mom. Use meaningful names that convey information about what they represent like length or length_in_centimetres. The PEP8 style guide, sets out how to write and format python programs. This includes a section on naming conventions\nSome languages recommend using camel case for variable naming. In this format words in a variable are distinguished by capital letters, but the first letter of the variable is lower case, e.g. lengthInCentimetres. Camel case is called this because the capital letters look like the humps of a camel. Either standard works, but when writing python it is best to stick to the python style guides\n\n\n\nPython does not limit the length of variable names\n\nThere should be no performance cost associated with long variable names\nLonger names can be hard to read\nNames should be no longer than they need to convey clear meaning\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve already seen that python can generate errors when it is unable to interpret an input. Answer the following questions to investigate how errors can arise in using variables. Assume that total has already been defined\n\nCan you identify an error in the statement below, which is supposed to add \\(10\\) to the variable total?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n Total = total + 10\n\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. Therefore Total and total are distinct variables. So this declares a new variable Total and assigns it the value of total + 10. The value of total itself is unchanged.\nThis is a logic error, it is a legal statement in python that generates the wrong behaviour\n\nLogic errors are some of the hardest errors to deal with since they (typically) don’t stop a program running, they just produce incorrect behaviour\nPython typically cannot warn you about them ahead of time\n\nThis variable misassignment is why python style guides recommend the use of all lowercase letters for variable names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOther languages with more strict type systems and variable declarations, may be able to identify logic errors like the one above.\n\n\nHow do we prevent logic errors?\n\nTesting\n\ni.e checking that the actual behaviour of a program matches the expected behaviour\nRun a program with input that will generate a known output when running correctly\n\nVerify the program generates this output\n\n\nTesting doesn’t guarantee a program is correct\n\nTypically hard to check all inputs and use cases\nDoes however give confidence and can provide that a program isn’t correct\n\nTypically tests should be written as the program is created or if using test-driven development the tests are written before the program itself is written\n\nThe statement below also contains a misspelling of the variable total. However, this time the name on the right-hand side of the equals is mispelled. What will happen when this program runs?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n total = Total + 10\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[9], line 2\n      1 total = 0\n----&gt; 2 total = Total + 10\n\nNameError: name 'Total' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, Total is not defined as a variable, so there is no meaningful way to interpret a value. Hence we would expect an error. Since the error is that Total doesn’t exist, we see a NameError.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the Nerves of Steel exercise from Chapter 3. In the game, players must remain standing right up to the moment before they think a random timer will expire\nOne suggestion is that the game might provide more skill if the program told the players how long they had to stand. The game now functions as a “Self-Timer”, the winner is now arguably the person who can best keep track of the time\nThe “game” sequence is\n\nSet the time to remain standing to a random number\nDisplay time to remain standing\nSleep for the time to remain standing\nDisplay a message for the winner\n\nObserve that the time is required to be used in two places, displaying the time remaining and then sleeping for that period of time. This means we need to use a variable to store the value of the time remaining\n# Chapter 4 Example 1: Self Timer\n# Based on original code by Rob Miles\n# Extends the Nerves of Steel Game from Chapter 3, by adding a skill element\n# with the players being informed of how long they have to stand for\n\nimport time\nimport random\n\nprint('Welcome to Self Timer')\nprint() #just prints a newline\nprint('Everybody stand up')\nprint('Stay standing until you think the time has ended')\nprint('Then sit down')\nprint('Anyone still standing when the time expires loses')\nprint('The last person to sit down before the time ended will win')\n\nstand_time = random.randint(5, 20) #generate the time to stand for\n\nprint('Stay standing for', stand_time, 'seconds.') #display standing time\ntime.sleep(stand_time) #sleep for the standing time\nprint('****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****')\n\n\nWelcome to Self Timer\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing until you think the time has ended\nThen sit down\nAnyone still standing when the time expires loses\nThe last person to sit down before the time ended will win\nStay standing for 12 seconds.\n****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****\n\n\n\nMost of the code is just text, but the key takeaway is the line stand_time = random.randint(5, 20) which assigns stand_time the result of random.randint(5, 20), i.e a random number from 5 to 20 inclusive\nWe then call stand_time is our call to print to display the time, and then sleep for the same amount of time\nObserve we couldn’t just write the number into both functions explicitly since it’s randomly generated, we would need to know ahead of time what the value will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables can also hold text, e.g. customer_name = 'fred' assigns the string 'fred' to customer_name\nCan use a string variable anywhere we would use a string literal, e.g. message = 'the name is ' + customer_name performs the string concatenation of 'the name is' and the value of customer_name and assigns the result to message\n\n\n\nPython tracks the contents of each variable and only allows operations that make sense. Using the python interpreter experiment with the following combinations of string and number variables.\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 25\ncustomer_name = 'fred'\n\nAfter entering the above two lines in the interpreter, run the following line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[12], line 1\n----&gt; 1 customer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n\n\n\nHere we are trying to add a number and a string, which we saw previously shouldn’t work. The terminal should provide some error output like the below\nNow try the below line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 'Fred'\n\nOne might expect the above to generate an error, after all we assign text to a variable that was just storing a number. Instead python simply discards the old numeric value of the variable, and now stores text in customer_age_in_years. You should generally avoid doing this, being able to reason about the type of a variable is typically an important part of safe and effective programming, and the weak typing of python is typically disliked outside of quick prototyping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above behaviour is an example of python as a what’s called a weakly typed language. Types are a quite developed part of programming theory that can be discussed later. In some languages, types are enforced to greater degrees of strictness. In some languages (like C) you can assign variables compatible types, i.e. ones that can be converted to the variable’s inate type. In other stricter languages a variable can only hold the exact specified type\nThe more strictly a language enforces its typing system typically the harder it is to generate errors at runtime, however they are often correspondingly more painful to actually write the code in the first place\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython lets you use either single-quotes (’) or double-quotes (“)\n\nLets us include ’ or ” in a string\n\nFor example, compare the two quote snippets,\n\n\nprint(\"It's a trap\")\n\nIt's a trap\n\n\n\nWhereas if we tried to just use single quotes,\n\n\nprint('It's a trap')\n\n\n  Cell In[15], line 1\n    print('It's a trap')\n                      ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single quote in It's ends the string, and we get a syntax error detecting what should be the closing single quote as opening a new string literal\nHow do we handle the case where we have mixed quotes in a string?\n\nWe use triple quotes, a series of three single or double quotes in a row, see the example below\n\n\n\nprint('''...and then Luke said \"It's a trap\"''')\n\n...and then Luke said \"It's a trap\"\n\n\n\nTriple quoted strings have the added advantage of capturing newlines. To see this, we could rewrite the intro string in Nerves of Steel as\n\n\nprint('''Welcome to Nerves of Steel\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing as long as you dare.\nSit down just before you think the time will end. ''')\n\nWelcome to Nerves of Steel\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing as long as you dare.\nSit down just before you think the time will end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nYou must using matching delimiters, if we try to mix them we’ll get an error\n\nprint('hello\")\n\n\n  Cell In[18], line 1\n    print('hello\")\n          ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape sequences are another way to include quote characters\nExtends to other symbols with meaning other than their literal character glyph in a string\nDenoted by the \\ character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape Sequence\nMeaning\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\\\\\nBackslash character (\\)\nEnter a backslash into a string\n\n\n\\'\nSingle Quote (')\nEnter a single quote into the string\n\n\n\\\"\nDouble Quote (\")\nEnter a double quote into the string\n\n\n\\n\nASCII Line Feed/New Line\nEnd this line and take a new one\n\n\n\\t\nASCII Tab\nMove to the right to the next tab stop\n\n\n\\r\nASCII Carriage Return\nReturn the printing position to the start of the line\n\n\n\\a\nASCII Bell\nSound the bell on the terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nASCII\nASCII (short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is an old format for character encoding that covers a small range of symbols including the latin alphabet and digits.\nASCII itself is less used today since it only covers around \\(100\\) characters, which is nowhere near enough to cover all modern languages, before you start adding in characters like emojis. However modern text encodings like unicode are typically backwards compatible with ASCII.\nNot all ASCII escape sequences may work on a modern computer. \\a was designed to ring a mechanical bell on old computers. Some modern computers may play a beep while others may do nothing. Similarly \\r is supposed to return the print head of a computer back to the start of the line. This has very limited use cases, and may not be implemented on all systems.\nThe most common escape characters are newline \\n and escaping quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNewline in Python\nPython uses \\n as the newline character. Technically this is known as a line feed and means “go to the next line”. In Linux and similar operating systems this is equivalent to starting a new line, but in windows going to the start of a new line is achieved via \\r\\n, i.e. return to the start of the line, and then feed to the next. Luckily python handles the conversion between the conventions automatically and we can just use \\n regardless of the operating system we are actually running on\n\n\n\n\nStart a python interpreter and answer the following questions\n\nWhat do you think the following quote would print?\nprint('hello\\nworld')\n\nWe would expect this print hello on one line, then world on the next\n\n\n\nhello\nworld\n\n\nWhat do you think the following would print?\n print('Item\\tSales\\ncar\\t50\\nboat\\t10')\n\nWe can see this prints a series of tab seperated lines. So this is essentially a tab seperated table (a similar format to the more familiar comma-seperated table)\n\n\n\nItem Sales\ncar  50\nboat 10\n\n\n\nThe exact spacing of tab characters can depend on the computer system, and it is quite common for text editors to convert tabs to spaces, so this format isn’t the best. We’ll see other ways to format strings later\n\nHow could I use Python escape sequences to print out this message?\n\nand then Luke said “It’s a trap”\n\n\nWe saw how to do this with triple-delimited strings before. Instead we just have to remember to instead use a single-delimiter string and then escape the quotes that actually form the string contents. See,\n\n\n print('and then Luke said \"It\\'s a trap\"')\n\nand then Luke said \"It's a trap\"\n\n\n\n\nSince the string is delimited by single quotes we only have to delimit the one single quote in It's rather than the two double quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen how to output data with print\nWe can also input data with the appropriately named input\nThe code snippet below, takes input from the user and stores it in name\n\n  name = input()\n\nThe program will pause until the user supplies the input, (Try it yourself in the interpreter!)\nWe can add a display prompt to the input statement\n\n  name = input('Enter your name please: ')\n\nThe above should output something like the below when run\n\n\n\nEnter your name please: \n\n\n\nAs mentioned input passes what it receives into the receiving variable.\n\nIf we just immediately press enter this is the empty string i.e. a string containing no characters\n\ninput is another technique for delaying the end of a program, e.g. the below prints a prompt and then holds the program until some input is received\n\ninput('Press enter to continue...')\n\n\nUse python to create a simple program that will issue a personalised greeting. Create a new program (greeter.py) with the following contents\nname = input('Enter your name please: ')\nprint('Hello', name)\nSave the program and execute it to see the output. For me the proram would output,\n\n\n\nEnter your name please: Felix\n\nHello Felix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI’ve used colour to emphase what is my input, versus the program’s output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput returns a string\n\nFine if we want that, but what if we want to handle numbers?\ne.g. if we wanted to have a user-specified egg timer\n\nint is a function that converts the argument to a whole number e.g.\n\ntime_text = input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: ') #receive time in seconds\ntime_int = int(time_next) #perform conversion to number\n\n\n\nThe complete program would then look like,\n\n# Example 4.3: Configurable Egg Timer\n# Reads in a user specified time to set the timer for\n\nimport time\n\ntime_text = input(\"Enter the cooking time in seconds: \")\ntime_int = int(time_text)\n\nprint(\"Put the egg in boiling water now\")\ninput(\"Press enter to continue once the egg is in...\")\n\ntime.sleep(time_int)\n\nprint(\"Take the egg out now\")\n\n\n\nConsider the previous example, and answer the following questions\n\nHow many variables are used in the program above?\n\ntwo, the first time_text stores the initial text input, while the second time_int contains the converted numeric representation\n\nCould you write the program without the time_text variable?\n\nYes, we could immediately pass the input result to int, e.g.\n\n time_int = int(input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: '))\n\nIt’s an open debate which format is clearer. In the second there’s more to grok on one line, but the whole workflow is there\n\nWhat do you think will happen if the user enters something other than a number?\n\nLet us find out,\n\n\n x = int('kaboom')\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[24], line 1\n----&gt; 1 x = int('kaboom')\n\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'kaboom'\n\n\n\n\nWe get an error, int tries to convert the string 'kaboom' to an integer, which it clearly cant\nThe art of programming to handle invalid input like the above is called error-handling, we’ll see that later\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of numbers\n\nWhole numbers or integers\n\nAre always held accurately by the computer\n\nReal numbers (or representations of) or floating point\n\nContain a fractional component\nMust be truncated to be stored in memory, so cannot always be stored accurately\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about the differences between whole numbers and real numbers through the following questions\n\nI’m building a device that can count the number of hairs on your head. Should this be stored as a whole or real number?\n\nInteger, we generally wouldn’t count fractions of a hair\nAlternatively, given how many hairs there are, and that we might not care about being precise, we might instead want to use a real number to store the approximate magnitude\n\nI want to use my hair-counting machine on \\(100\\) people and determine the average number of hairs on all their heads. Should I use this value as a whole or real number?\n\nWe expect that the average will not be a whole number, so we should store it as a real number\nAlternatively, we may not care about getting the number exact down to the fraction, so we could use a whole number to round to the nearest number\n\nI want to keep track of the price of a product in my program. Should I use whole numbers or real numbers?\n\nNaively we would a real number, however as we mentioned real numbers have some uncertainty stored in them\nWhen dealing with financial values we need to maintain that precision\n\nInstead we might then use whole cents\n\nWorks straightforward if we only care about the total\nIf we care about averages, or fractions of a total then we might have to reconsider\n\nThere are techniques used to control the error in a real number calculation\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the argument of what numerical type to use, requires understanding both the nature of the value itself, and what you want to do with it. You can then consider the properties of the numeric representation and choose the most appropriate one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe way you store a variable depends on what you want to do with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal numbers have a fractional part\n\nTheir representation may not align 1:1 with what was originally input\n\nThe most common way to store real numbers is called floating point\n\nThe floating means that the decimal point moves around in the representation, as opposed to a fixed point representation which has a set number of digits after the decimal point\nUsing more memory to store a float lets us store it with greater precision, but we can never accurately represent all floating point numbers\n\nReal numbers can be defined by range and precision\n\nPrecision governs how precisely a number is stored e.g. a float may be able to store \\(123456789.0\\) or \\(0.123456789\\) but not \\(123456789.987654321\\) because the precision required is too great\nRange determines how much we can slide the decimal point to represent large or small numbers e.g. we could store \\(123456700\\) or \\(0.0001234567\\)\nIn Python floats have \\(15-16\\) digits of precision and can range from \\(10^{308}\\) and \\(10^{-324}\\)\n\nA quirk of floating point is that some apparently simple numbers like \\(0.1\\) can’t be stored exactly\n\n\n\nConduct the following experiments in the python shell to learn about floating points\n\nWhat happens if we try to store a value that can’t be held accurately as a floating-point value?\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n\n\nAbove we said that \\(0.1\\) couldn’t be exactly represented, but that doesn’t match with what we just saw. The answer is because the error in the representation is very small, and print rounds off the answer\n\nDoes the rounding really happen? Run the following and comment on the result\n\n 0.1 + 0.2\n\n0.30000000000000004\n\n\n\nWe expected the answer to be \\(0.3\\) but instead we see a slight error. This is because there is an error accumulation from adding \\(0.1\\) to \\(0.2\\) and the underlying floating point representations\n\n\n\nThese issues are not python specific. They are an inate challenge of trying to represent real numbers on hardware. Modern floating-point numbers are also an internationally recognised standard which lets different programs and hardware talk to each other.\nPython differs from some languages in only providing a single floating point type that is \\(8\\) bytes. In many languages this is referred to as a double-precision floating point or just a double and is one of several floating point types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDon’t confuse precision with accuracy\nNumbers don’t become more accurate when they are stored with more precision. Scientists often measure values with a measure of uncertainty which captures how sure they are in the accuracy of their number. There is no point storing a value to \\(15\\) decimal places of precision, if the accuracy of a measurement is only to \\(1-2\\) places, e.g. if we measure with a ruler\nUsing higher precision can result in slower programs that use more memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython automatically creates variables for use in programs\nThe type of a variable is determined by what is stored in it\n\nname = 'Rob'\nage = 25\n\nThe above creates two variables\n\nOne name is a string type\nThe other age is an int or integer type\n\nYou can create a floating point variable by assigning a floating point number e.g. the below creates a variable x and assigns it the floating point value \\(1.5\\)\n\n\nx = 1.5\nx\n\n1.5\n\n\n\nLet’s consider what happens if we assign integral values to floating point variables\n\nThe below assigns the integer value \\(1.0\\) to a variable y\nIf we print the value back we can say it keeps the decimal, indicating it is a floating point value\n\n\n  y = 1.0\n  y\n\n1.0\n\n\n\ni.e. by writing the decimal point we coerce the type of y to be floating point\n\nThe next question is to consider what happens when we mix integer and floating point types in operations, e.g. if we compare the two additions below, we can see that when we add floating points, the addition stays a floating point even if the result is integral\n\n  2 + 2\n\n4\n\n\n\n  2.0 + 2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\nIf we mix a floating point and integer type we can also see that the result is returned as a floating point (even when the final result is integral)\n\n2 + 2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\nLastly what happens if we divide two coprime integers?, we see that the result gives the appropriate floating point fraction\n\n\n1/2\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile the last point about division behaviour may seem obvious if you haven’t programmed before you would do well to be careful. In many common languages, division of two integers is treated as integer division. In this case the result is always an integer with the result being rounded according to some scheme. Three common schemes are towards zero, in which the result is always rounded towards the number \\(0\\); towards the nearest, where the result is rounded to the nearest whole number and floored division in which the number is rounded towards negative infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision\nExample\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\ntowards zero\n\\(-1/2 = 0\\)\nDiscard decimal digits\n\n\ntowards nearest\n\\(3.2/2 = 2\\)\nMinimise the difference between “true” division and result\n\n\nfloored division\n\\(-1/2 = -1\\)\nRound “down”\n\n\n\nPython lets you perform integer division using floored division behaviour with the // operator e.g.\n\n-1//2\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting string to float, works identically to as for int but we use float instead\n\ne.g. We could rewrite the configurable egg timer with floats as,\n\n\ntime_text = input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: ')\ntime_float = float(time_text)\n\n\nThe complete program would then look like\n# Example 4.4\n# Ultra-Precise Egg Timer\n#\n# A version of the Configurable Egg Timer using floating point for the input time\n\nimport time\n\ntime_text = input(\"Enter the cooking time in seconds: \")\ntime_float = float(time_text)\n\nprint(\"Put the egg in boiling water now\")\ninput(\"Press enter to continue once the egg is in...\")\n\ntime.sleep(time_float)\n\nprint(\"Take the egg out now\")\nYou can see the code is the same except we make the subsitution int \\(\\to\\) float\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before python is an expression evaluator\nAn expression consists of operators and operands\nPython evaluates an expression left to right, and carries out operations according to their order of operations\n\nAnalogous to mathematical order of operations (and includes them) but must extend for programming specific syntax\nAs in maths, parentheses are used to enforce an evaluation order\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nUsecase\n\n\n\n\n-\nUnary minus, denotes a negative number\n\n\n*\nMultiplication (inlieu of \\(\\times\\))\n\n\n/\nDivision\n\n\n+\nAddition\n\n\n-\nbinary minus or subtraction\n\n\n\n\nBasic operators and their precedence\n\n\n\nSee if you can work out the values of a, b and c when the following statements are evaluated,\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nc = c * (a + b)\nb = a + b + c\nThe first three lines give a = \\(1\\), b = \\(2\\) and c = \\(3\\). Substituting those into the second evaluation for c,\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\nc = 3 * (1 + 2)\nc\n\n9\n\n\nSo c is assigned \\(9\\). We then repeat for the second assignment to b to get,\n\nb = 1 + 2 + 9\n\nSo the final values are, a = \\(1\\), b = \\(12\\), c = \\(9\\). If we execute the original cell we can confirm this\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nc = c * (a + b)\nb = a + b + c\n\nprint('a: ', a)\nprint('b: ', b)\nprint('c: ', c)\n\na:  1\nb:  12\nc:  9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPython won’t try and stop you if you do something that mathematically makes no sense like dividing a number by zero, instead an error is raised, but this won’t occur until your program runs! Therefore when using division you should always take care to make sure you either handling division by zero cases appropriately or preventing them from occuring\n\n1/0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[37], line 1\n----&gt; 1 1/0\n\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n\n\nWhen using other languages, they may not raise and error, instead unexpected behaviour may occur including your program crashing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw floatcan be used to convert a string to a float.\n\nIt can also be used to convert an integer value to a floating point value, e.g.\n\n\n\nz = float(1)\nz\n\n1.0\n\n\n\nIf we want to go the other way we can use int to convert a float to an int.\n\nThe number is rounded towards zero, i.e. fractional components are truncated (see @integer-division)\n\n\n\ni = int(2.9)\ni\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following program which is designed to calculate the number of pizzas needed for a hackathon with \\(x\\) number of particpants using the heuristic that \\(1\\) pizza can satisfy \\(1.5\\) people\n# Example 4.5: Pizza Order Calculator\n# A basic pizza order calculator based on the heuristic that 1 pizza = 1.5 people fed\n\nstudents_int = int(\n    input(\"How many students are attending? \")\n)  # read in string, convert to int and store\npizza_count = students_int / 1.5  # perform division int -&gt; float\nprint(\"You will need\", pizza_count, \"pizzas\")\nNote, that I’ve modified the code to directly pass the input to int and then to a variable, to demonstrate that it’s possible.\nThe above program has the problem that for any number not divisible by \\(1.5\\), the program recommends ordering a fractional number of pizzas.

    "text": "Variables let us add memory to python\n\nCan be viewed as an alias for a storage location\n\nVariables in python are created by defining a name, and providing a value, e.g. the below defines a variable total and assigns it the value \\(0\\)\n\n\ntotal = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 3\n    space\n    title[\"Anatomy of Variable Assignment\"]\n    space\n\n    block:variable\n    columns 1\n        varName[\"total\"]\n        variablebody[\"variable\"]\n        variableDescr[\"(thing to which value assigned)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:equals\n    columns 1\n        equalsSymbol[\"=\"]\n        equalsName[\"equals\"]\n        equalsDescr[\"(means assign)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:argumentblock\n    columns 1\n        zero[\"0\"]\n        zeroName[\"expression\"]\n        zeroDescr[\"(value to assign)\"]\n    end\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass variablebody BG\nclass variableDescr BG\nclass equalsName BG\nclass equalsDescr BG\nclass zeroName BG\nclass zeroDescr BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagramatically breaks down variable assignment. On the left we have the variable, then = which means assignment, followed by the expression to assign\nThe assignment expression does not need to be made of simple primitives, e.g. total = us_sales + world_wide_sales defines the variable total to be equal to the sum of the variables us_sales and world_wide_sales\n\n\n\nStart up a python interpreter, then run the following commands in sequence\n\ntotal = 0\n\n total = 0\n\n\nNo output is generated, the assignment is performed silently\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n0\n\n\n\n0 output\ntotal has been assigned 0, putting the variable name into the terminal returns the value associated with this value\n\ntotal = total + 10\n\n total = total + 10\n\n\nNo output\nLike with the first statement, variable assignment generates no output\nHere we assign total the value given by the current value of total plus \\(10\\)\n\ntotal\n\n total\n\n10\n\n\n\n10 output\nThe new value of total is printed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables require names\nPython variable names must obey a number of rules\n\nMust start with a letter or _\nCan contain letters, numbers or _ characters\n\nSome valid names are\n\ntotal\nxyz -t0tal\n\nSome invalid names are\n\n2_be_or_not_to_be\n\nStarts with a number which is not allowed\n\ntot@l\n\n@ is not a valid character for a variable name\n\n\nPython names are case sensitive, i.e. FRED and fred are distinct variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCreate Meaningful Names\nDon’t use silly or meaningless names like hello_mom. Use meaningful names that convey information about what they represent like length or length_in_centimetres. The PEP8 style guide, sets out how to write and format python programs. This includes a section on naming conventions\nSome languages recommend using camel case for variable naming. In this format words in a variable are distinguished by capital letters, but the first letter of the variable is lower case, e.g. lengthInCentimetres. Camel case is called this because the capital letters look like the humps of a camel. Either standard works, but when writing python it is best to stick to the python style guides\n\n\n\nPython does not limit the length of variable names\n\nThere should be no performance cost associated with long variable names\nLonger names can be hard to read\nNames should be no longer than they need to convey clear meaning\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve already seen that python can generate errors when it is unable to interpret an input. Answer the following questions to investigate how errors can arise in using variables. Assume that total has already been defined\n\nCan you identify an error in the statement below, which is supposed to add \\(10\\) to the variable total?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n Total = total + 10\n\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. Therefore Total and total are distinct variables. So this declares a new variable Total and assigns it the value of total + 10. The value of total itself is unchanged.\nThis is a logic error, it is a legal statement in python that generates the wrong behaviour\n\nLogic errors are some of the hardest errors to deal with since they (typically) don’t stop a program running, they just produce incorrect behaviour\nPython typically cannot warn you about them ahead of time\n\nThis variable misassignment is why python style guides recommend the use of all lowercase letters for variable names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOther languages with more strict type systems and variable declarations, may be able to identify logic errors like the one above.\n\n\nHow do we prevent logic errors?\n\nTesting\n\ni.e checking that the actual behaviour of a program matches the expected behaviour\nRun a program with input that will generate a known output when running correctly\n\nVerify the program generates this output\n\n\nTesting doesn’t guarantee a program is correct\n\nTypically hard to check all inputs and use cases\nDoes however give confidence and can provide that a program isn’t correct\n\nTypically tests should be written as the program is created or if using test-driven development the tests are written before the program itself is written\n\nThe statement below also contains a misspelling of the variable total. However, this time the name on the right-hand side of the equals is mispelled. What will happen when this program runs?\n\n #| echo: false\n %reset\n\n\n total = 0\n total = Total + 10\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[9], line 2\n      1 total = 0\n----&gt; 2 total = Total + 10\n\nNameError: name 'Total' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, Total is not defined as a variable, so there is no meaningful way to interpret a value. Hence we would expect an error. Since the error is that Total doesn’t exist, we see a NameError.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the Nerves of Steel exercise from Chapter 3. In the game, players must remain standing right up to the moment before they think a random timer will expire\nOne suggestion is that the game might provide more skill if the program told the players how long they had to stand. The game now functions as a “Self-Timer”, the winner is now arguably the person who can best keep track of the time\nThe “game” sequence is\n\nSet the time to remain standing to a random number\nDisplay time to remain standing\nSleep for the time to remain standing\nDisplay a message for the winner\n\nObserve that the time is required to be used in two places, displaying the time remaining and then sleeping for that period of time. This means we need to use a variable to store the value of the time remaining\n# Chapter 4 Example 1: Self Timer\n# Based on original code by Rob Miles\n# Extends the Nerves of Steel Game from Chapter 3, by adding a skill element\n# with the players being informed of how long they have to stand for\n\nimport time\nimport random\n\nprint('Welcome to Self Timer')\nprint() #just prints a newline\nprint('Everybody stand up')\nprint('Stay standing until you think the time has ended')\nprint('Then sit down')\nprint('Anyone still standing when the time expires loses')\nprint('The last person to sit down before the time ended will win')\n\nstand_time = random.randint(5, 20) #generate the time to stand for\n\nprint('Stay standing for', stand_time, 'seconds.') #display standing time\ntime.sleep(stand_time) #sleep for the standing time\nprint('****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****')\n\n\nWelcome to Self Timer\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing until you think the time has ended\nThen sit down\nAnyone still standing when the time expires loses\nThe last person to sit down before the time ended will win\nStay standing for 12 seconds.\n****TIMES UP, LAST TO SIT WINS!****\n\n\n\nMost of the code is just text, but the key takeaway is the line stand_time = random.randint(5, 20) which assigns stand_time the result of random.randint(5, 20), i.e a random number from 5 to 20 inclusive\nWe then call stand_time is our call to print to display the time, and then sleep for the same amount of time\nObserve we couldn’t just write the number into both functions explicitly since it’s randomly generated, we would need to know ahead of time what the value will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables can also hold text, e.g. customer_name = 'fred' assigns the string 'fred' to customer_name\nCan use a string variable anywhere we would use a string literal, e.g. message = 'the name is ' + customer_name performs the string concatenation of 'the name is' and the value of customer_name and assigns the result to message\n\n\n\nPython tracks the contents of each variable and only allows operations that make sense. Using the python interpreter experiment with the following combinations of string and number variables.\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 25\ncustomer_name = 'fred'\n\nAfter entering the above two lines in the interpreter, run the following line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[12], line 1\n----&gt; 1 customer_age_in_years + customer_name\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n\n\n\nHere we are trying to add a number and a string, which we saw previously shouldn’t work. The terminal should provide some error output like the below\nNow try the below line\n\ncustomer_age_in_years = 'Fred'\n\nOne might expect the above to generate an error, after all we assign text to a variable that was just storing a number. Instead python simply discards the old numeric value of the variable, and now stores text in customer_age_in_years. You should generally avoid doing this, being able to reason about the type of a variable is typically an important part of safe and effective programming, and the weak typing of python is typically disliked outside of quick prototyping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above behaviour is an example of python as a what’s called a weakly typed language. Types are a quite developed part of programming theory that can be discussed later. In some languages, types are enforced to greater degrees of strictness. In some languages (like C) you can assign variables compatible types, i.e. ones that can be converted to the variable’s inate type. In other stricter languages a variable can only hold the exact specified type\nThe more strictly a language enforces its typing system typically the harder it is to generate errors at runtime, however they are often correspondingly more painful to actually write the code in the first place\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython lets you use either single-quotes (’) or double-quotes (“)\n\nLets us include ’ or ” in a string\n\nFor example, compare the two quote snippets,\n\n\nprint(\"It's a trap\")\n\nIt's a trap\n\n\n\nWhereas if we tried to just use single quotes,\n\n\nprint('It's a trap')\n\n\n  Cell In[15], line 1\n    print('It's a trap')\n                      ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single quote in It's ends the string, and we get a syntax error detecting what should be the closing single quote as opening a new string literal\nHow do we handle the case where we have mixed quotes in a string?\n\nWe use triple quotes, a series of three single or double quotes in a row, see the example below\n\n\n\nprint('''...and then Luke said \"It's a trap\"''')\n\n...and then Luke said \"It's a trap\"\n\n\n\nTriple quoted strings have the added advantage of capturing newlines. To see this, we could rewrite the intro string in Nerves of Steel as\n\n\nprint('''Welcome to Nerves of Steel\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing as long as you dare.\nSit down just before you think the time will end. ''')\n\nWelcome to Nerves of Steel\n\nEverybody stand up\nStay standing as long as you dare.\nSit down just before you think the time will end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nYou must using matching delimiters, if we try to mix them we’ll get an error\n\nprint('hello\")\n\n\n  Cell In[18], line 1\n    print('hello\")\n          ^\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape sequences are another way to include quote characters\nExtends to other symbols with meaning other than their literal character glyph in a string\nDenoted by the \\ character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape Sequence\nMeaning\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n\\\\\nBackslash character (\\)\nEnter a backslash into a string\n\n\n\\'\nSingle Quote (')\nEnter a single quote into the string\n\n\n\\\"\nDouble Quote (\")\nEnter a double quote into the string\n\n\n\\n\nASCII Line Feed/New Line\nEnd this line and take a new one\n\n\n\\t\nASCII Tab\nMove to the right to the next tab stop\n\n\n\\r\nASCII Carriage Return\nReturn the printing position to the start of the line\n\n\n\\a\nASCII Bell\nSound the bell on the terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nASCII\nASCII (short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is an old format for character encoding that covers a small range of symbols including the latin alphabet and digits.\nASCII itself is less used today since it only covers around \\(100\\) characters, which is nowhere near enough to cover all modern languages, before you start adding in characters like emojis. However modern text encodings like unicode are typically backwards compatible with ASCII.\nNot all ASCII escape sequences may work on a modern computer. \\a was designed to ring a mechanical bell on old computers. Some modern computers may play a beep while others may do nothing. Similarly \\r is supposed to return the print head of a computer back to the start of the line. This has very limited use cases, and may not be implemented on all systems.\nThe most common escape characters are newline \\n and escaping quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNewline in Python\nPython uses \\n as the newline character. Technically this is known as a line feed and means “go to the next line”. In Linux and similar operating systems this is equivalent to starting a new line, but in windows going to the start of a new line is achieved via \\r\\n, i.e. return to the start of the line, and then feed to the next. Luckily python handles the conversion between the conventions automatically and we can just use \\n regardless of the operating system we are actually running on\n\n\n\n\nStart a python interpreter and answer the following questions\n\nWhat do you think the following quote would print?\nprint('hello\\nworld')\n\nWe would expect this print hello on one line, then world on the next\n\n\n\nhello\nworld\n\n\nWhat do you think the following would print?\n print('Item\\tSales\\ncar\\t50\\nboat\\t10')\n\nWe can see this prints a series of tab seperated lines. So this is essentially a tab seperated table (a similar format to the more familiar comma-seperated table)\n\n\n\nItem Sales\ncar  50\nboat 10\n\n\n\nThe exact spacing of tab characters can depend on the computer system, and it is quite common for text editors to convert tabs to spaces, so this format isn’t the best. We’ll see other ways to format strings later\n\nHow could I use Python escape sequences to print out this message?\n\nand then Luke said “It’s a trap”\n\n\nWe saw how to do this with triple-delimited strings before. Instead we just have to remember to instead use a single-delimiter string and then escape the quotes that actually form the string contents. See,\n\n\n print('and then Luke said \"It\\'s a trap\"')\n\nand then Luke said \"It's a trap\"\n\n\n\n\nSince the string is delimited by single quotes we only have to delimit the one single quote in It's rather than the two double quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen how to output data with print\nWe can also input data with the appropriately named input\nThe code snippet below, takes input from the user and stores it in name\n\n  name = input()\n\nThe program will pause until the user supplies the input, (Try it yourself in the interpreter!)\nWe can add a display prompt to the input statement\n\n  name = input('Enter your name please: ')\n\nThe above should output something like the below when run\n\n\n\nEnter your name please: \n\n\n\nAs mentioned input passes what it receives into the receiving variable.\n\nIf we just immediately press enter this is the empty string i.e. a string containing no characters\n\ninput is another technique for delaying the end of a program, e.g. the below prints a prompt and then holds the program until some input is received\n\ninput('Press enter to continue...')\n\n\nUse python to create a simple program that will issue a personalised greeting. Create a new program (greeter.py) with the following contents\nname = input('Enter your name please: ')\nprint('Hello', name)\nSave the program and execute it to see the output. For me the proram would output,\n\n\n\nEnter your name please: Felix\n\nHello Felix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI’ve used colour to emphase what is my input, versus the program’s output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput returns a string\n\nFine if we want that, but what if we want to handle numbers?\ne.g. if we wanted to have a user-specified egg timer\n\nint is a function that converts the argument to a whole number e.g.\n\ntime_text = input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: ') #receive time in seconds\ntime_int = int(time_next) #perform conversion to number\n\n\n\nThe complete program would then look like,\n\n# Example 4.3: Configurable Egg Timer\n# Reads in a user specified time to set the timer for\n\nimport time\n\ntime_text = input(\"Enter the cooking time in seconds: \")\ntime_int = int(time_text)\n\nprint(\"Put the egg in boiling water now\")\ninput(\"Press enter to continue once the egg is in...\")\n\ntime.sleep(time_int)\n\nprint(\"Take the egg out now\")\n\n\n\nConsider the previous example, and answer the following questions\n\nHow many variables are used in the program above?\n\ntwo, the first time_text stores the initial text input, while the second time_int contains the converted numeric representation\n\nCould you write the program without the time_text variable?\n\nYes, we could immediately pass the input result to int, e.g.\n\n time_int = int(input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: '))\n\nIt’s an open debate which format is clearer. In the second there’s more to grok on one line, but the whole workflow is there\n\nWhat do you think will happen if the user enters something other than a number?\n\nLet us find out,\n\n\n x = int('kaboom')\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[24], line 1\n----&gt; 1 x = int('kaboom')\n\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'kaboom'\n\n\n\n\nWe get an error, int tries to convert the string 'kaboom' to an integer, which it clearly cant\nThe art of programming to handle invalid input like the above is called error-handling, we’ll see that later\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two types of numbers\n\nWhole numbers or integers\n\nAre always held accurately by the computer\n\nReal numbers (or representations of) or floating point\n\nContain a fractional component\nMust be truncated to be stored in memory, so cannot always be stored accurately\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about the differences between whole numbers and real numbers through the following questions\n\nI’m building a device that can count the number of hairs on your head. Should this be stored as a whole or real number?\n\nInteger, we generally wouldn’t count fractions of a hair\nAlternatively, given how many hairs there are, and that we might not care about being precise, we might instead want to use a real number to store the approximate magnitude\n\nI want to use my hair-counting machine on \\(100\\) people and determine the average number of hairs on all their heads. Should I use this value as a whole or real number?\n\nWe expect that the average will not be a whole number, so we should store it as a real number\nAlternatively, we may not care about getting the number exact down to the fraction, so we could use a whole number to round to the nearest number\n\nI want to keep track of the price of a product in my program. Should I use whole numbers or real numbers?\n\nNaively we would a real number, however as we mentioned real numbers have some uncertainty stored in them\nWhen dealing with financial values we need to maintain that precision\n\nInstead we might then use whole cents\n\nWorks straightforward if we only care about the total\nIf we care about averages, or fractions of a total then we might have to reconsider\n\nThere are techniques used to control the error in a real number calculation\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the argument of what numerical type to use, requires understanding both the nature of the value itself, and what you want to do with it. You can then consider the properties of the numeric representation and choose the most appropriate one\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe way you store a variable depends on what you want to do with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal numbers have a fractional part\n\nTheir representation may not align 1:1 with what was originally input\n\nThe most common way to store real numbers is called floating point\n\nThe floating means that the decimal point moves around in the representation, as opposed to a fixed point representation which has a set number of digits after the decimal point\nUsing more memory to store a float lets us store it with greater precision, but we can never accurately represent all floating point numbers\n\nReal numbers can be defined by range and precision\n\nPrecision governs how precisely a number is stored e.g. a float may be able to store \\(123456789.0\\) or \\(0.123456789\\) but not \\(123456789.987654321\\) because the precision required is too great\nRange determines how much we can slide the decimal point to represent large or small numbers e.g. we could store \\(123456700\\) or \\(0.0001234567\\)\nIn Python floats have \\(15-16\\) digits of precision and can range from \\(10^{308}\\) and \\(10^{-324}\\)\n\nA quirk of floating point is that some apparently simple numbers like \\(0.1\\) can’t be stored exactly\n\n\n\nConduct the following experiments in the python shell to learn about floating points\n\nWhat happens if we try to store a value that can’t be held accurately as a floating-point value?\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n\n\nAbove we said that \\(0.1\\) couldn’t be exactly represented, but that doesn’t match with what we just saw. The answer is because the error in the representation is very small, and print rounds off the answer\n\nDoes the rounding really happen? Run the following and comment on the result\n\n 0.1 + 0.2\n\n0.30000000000000004\n\n\n\nWe expected the answer to be \\(0.3\\) but instead we see a slight error. This is because there is an error accumulation from adding \\(0.1\\) to \\(0.2\\) and the underlying floating point representations\n\n\n\nThese issues are not python specific. They are an inate challenge of trying to represent real numbers on hardware. Modern floating-point numbers are also an internationally recognised standard which lets different programs and hardware talk to each other.\nPython differs from some languages in only providing a single floating point type that is \\(8\\) bytes. In many languages this is referred to as a double-precision floating point or just a double and is one of several floating point types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDon’t confuse precision with accuracy\nNumbers don’t become more accurate when they are stored with more precision. Scientists often measure values with a measure of uncertainty which captures how sure they are in the accuracy of their number. There is no point storing a value to \\(15\\) decimal places of precision, if the accuracy of a measurement is only to \\(1-2\\) places, e.g. if we measure with a ruler\nUsing higher precision can result in slower programs that use more memory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython automatically creates variables for use in programs\nThe type of a variable is determined by what is stored in it\n\nname = 'Rob'\nage = 25\n\nThe above creates two variables\n\nOne name is a string type\nThe other age is an int or integer type\n\nYou can create a floating point variable by assigning a floating point number e.g. the below creates a variable x and assigns it the floating point value \\(1.5\\)\n\n\nx = 1.5\nx\n\n1.5\n\n\n\nLet’s consider what happens if we assign integral values to floating point variables\n\nThe below assigns the integer value \\(1.0\\) to a variable y\nIf we print the value back we can say it keeps the decimal, indicating it is a floating point value\n\n\n  y = 1.0\n  y\n\n1.0\n\n\n\ni.e. by writing the decimal point we coerce the type of y to be floating point\n\nThe next question is to consider what happens when we mix integer and floating point types in operations, e.g. if we compare the two additions below, we can see that when we add floating points, the addition stays a floating point even if the result is integral\n\n  2 + 2\n\n4\n\n\n\n  2.0 + 2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\nIf we mix a floating point and integer type we can also see that the result is returned as a floating point (even when the final result is integral)\n\n2 + 2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\nLastly what happens if we divide two coprime integers?, we see that the result gives the appropriate floating point fraction\n\n\n1/2\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile the last point about division behaviour may seem obvious if you haven’t programmed before you would do well to be careful. In many common languages, division of two integers is treated as integer division. In this case the result is always an integer with the result being rounded according to some scheme. Three common schemes are towards zero, in which the result is always rounded towards the number \\(0\\); towards the nearest, where the result is rounded to the nearest whole number and floored division in which the number is rounded towards negative infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision\nExample\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\ntowards zero\n\\(-1/2 = 0\\)\nDiscard decimal digits\n\n\ntowards nearest\n\\(3.2/2 = 2\\)\nMinimise the difference between “true” division and result\n\n\nfloored division\n\\(-1/2 = -1\\)\nRound “down”\n\n\n\nPython lets you perform integer division using floored division behaviour with the // operator e.g.\n\n-1//2\n\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting string to float, works identically to as for int but we use float instead\n\ne.g. We could rewrite the configurable egg timer with floats as,\n\n\ntime_text = input('Enter the cooking time in seconds: ')\ntime_float = float(time_text)\n\n\nThe complete program would then look like\n# Example 4.4\n# Ultra-Precise Egg Timer\n#\n# A version of the Configurable Egg Timer using floating point for the input time\n\nimport time\n\ntime_text = input(\"Enter the cooking time in seconds: \")\ntime_float = float(time_text)\n\nprint(\"Put the egg in boiling water now\")\ninput(\"Press enter to continue once the egg is in...\")\n\ntime.sleep(time_float)\n\nprint(\"Take the egg out now\")\nYou can see the code is the same except we make the subsitution int \\(\\to\\) float\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before python is an expression evaluator\nAn expression consists of operators and operands\nPython evaluates an expression left to right, and carries out operations according to their order of operations\n\nAnalogous to mathematical order of operations (and includes them) but must extend for programming specific syntax\nAs in maths, parentheses are used to enforce an evaluation order\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nUsecase\n\n\n\n\n-\nUnary minus, denotes a negative number\n\n\n*\nMultiplication (inlieu of \\(\\times\\))\n\n\n/\nDivision\n\n\n+\nAddition\n\n\n-\nbinary minus or subtraction\n\n\n\n\nBasic operators and their precedence\n\n\n\nSee if you can work out the values of a, b and c when the following statements are evaluated,\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nc = c * (a + b)\nb = a + b + c\nThe first three lines give a = \\(1\\), b = \\(2\\) and c = \\(3\\). Substituting those into the second evaluation for c,\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\nc = 3 * (1 + 2)\nc\n\n9\n\n\nSo c is assigned \\(9\\). We then repeat for the second assignment to b to get,\n\nb = 1 + 2 + 9\n\nSo the final values are, a = \\(1\\), b = \\(12\\), c = \\(9\\). If we execute the original cell we can confirm this\n\na = 1\nb = 2\nc = a + b\n\nc = c * (a + b)\nb = a + b + c\n\nprint('a: ', a)\nprint('b: ', b)\nprint('c: ', c)\n\na:  1\nb:  12\nc:  9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nPython won’t try and stop you if you do something that mathematically makes no sense like dividing a number by zero, instead an error is raised, but this won’t occur until your program runs! Therefore when using division you should always take care to make sure you either handling division by zero cases appropriately or preventing them from occuring\n\n1/0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[37], line 1\n----&gt; 1 1/0\n\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n\n\nWhen using other languages, they may not raise and error, instead unexpected behaviour may occur including your program crashing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw floatcan be used to convert a string to a float.\n\nIt can also be used to convert an integer value to a floating point value, e.g.\n\n\n\nz = float(1)\nz\n\n1.0\n\n\n\nIf we want to go the other way we can use int to convert a float to an int.\n\nThe number is rounded towards zero, i.e. fractional components are truncated (see @integer-division)\n\n\n\ni = int(2.9)\ni\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following program which is designed to calculate the number of pizzas needed for a hackathon with \\(x\\) number of particpants using the heuristic that \\(1\\) pizza can satisfy \\(1.5\\) people\n# Example 4.5: Pizza Order Calculator\n# A basic pizza order calculator based on the heuristic that 1 pizza = 1.5 people fed\n\nstudents_int = int(\n    input(\"How many students are attending? \")\n)  # read in string, convert to int and store\npizza_count = students_int / 1.5  # perform division int -&gt; float\nprint(\"You will need\", pizza_count, \"pizzas\")\nNote, that I’ve modified the code to directly pass the input to int and then to a variable, to demonstrate that it’s possible.\nThe above program has the problem that for any number not divisible by \\(1.5\\), the program recommends ordering a fractional number of pizzas.

Since it’s generally better for there to be a little left over than someone go hungry, this behaviour is probably preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNever assume you know what a program is supposed to do\nWhen faced with a choice like the above for the pizza order calculator for a product being made by a client, you should not decide what the expected behaviour is yourself. For example, in the above the customer may prefer to round down the number of pizzas to reduce cost.\nNever assume you know what the program should do, ask the client\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a program to convert from Fahrenheit to Centigrade.

We move to the next statement outside of the loop and print out \"Outside Loop\"\nThe pattern of using a control variable that is updated in the loop body in a while loop is very common\n\nWhat will the following program print?\n flag = True\n while flag:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n     Flag = False\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nThis looks similar to the previous, but note the typo, we refer to Flag not flag inside the loop, which defines a new variable, instead of modifying the loop control. We thus get an infinite series of \"Inside Loop\" being printed.\n\nWhat will the following program print?\n\n count = 0\n while count &lt; 5:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n     count = count + 1\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nOutside Loop\n\n\n\ncount is initially set to \\(0\\), at each iteration we print \"Inside Loop\" and increase the value of count by \\(1\\).

All you need to do is put all of the statements that implement the theme park behaviour into a while True construction\nFor usability our program won’t loop endlessly. We’ll say that any number that it is not a valid ride number is code for quitting the program. The relevant changes to the Ride Selector are then,\nrun_program = True\n\nwhile run_program:\n    print(\"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n        These are the available ride:\n\n        1. Scenic River Cruise\n        2. Carnival Carousel\n        3. Jungle Adventure Water Splash\n        4. Downhill Mountain Run\n        5.

When a user enters a number we first check if it corresponds to a ride number and if not, we set the program to quit on the next loop iteration by setting run_program to False. We now change the original if ride_number == 1 to and elif so it is only checked if we know the ride_number is valid. (The full code is in LoopingRideSelector.py)\n\n\n\nOne of the examples in the above question set involved a countup to \\(5\\). Implement a program that counts down from \\(10\\) to \\(0\\) over \\(10\\) seconds\n# Exercise 6.2: Countdown\n# Performs a 10-second countdown\n\nimport time\n\ntime_left = 10\n\nwhile time_left &gt;= 0:\n    print(time_left)\n    time_left = time_left - 1\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nThis is a straightforward exercise (see Countdown.py), we set up our counter value to \\(10\\) and use the appropriate loop expression (here time_left &gt;= 0) to ensure that \\(0\\) is included in the countdown.\nIn the loop we print the current value of time_left, then decrement time_left by \\(1\\), and sleep for the required time. Observe that after the program prints \\(0\\), time_left becomes \\(-1\\) and the next iteration of the loop won’t run.\n\n\n\n\nRide Selector doesn’t account for invalid user entry\n\nBlindly assumes a number outside the range \\(1\\) to \\(5\\) represents quitting the program\n\nIdeally we would like to have a distinct number that represents quitting and a way to capture and handle any invalid inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGreat Programmers Think Defensively\nDefensive programming is a programming technique in which a programmer attempts to defend their code against possible errors that might occur in a code e.g. receiving a word when expecting a number\nIt is good practice to think about, typically a user expects a computer to do something reasonable even when provided unreasonable input.\nData validation does have the downside in that it can make programs significantly bigger, and in compiled languages knowing that data is valid can make them much faster. A good skill is learning the correct layers or boundaries of a program to perform the defensive data validation so the core can run without concern\n\n\n\nIgnoring the question of quitting for now, data validation for the ride selector might look like,\n  if ride_number &lt; 1 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n      print('Invalid ride number')\n\n\n\n\nAbove acknowledges the error, but if we want to use this in our loop control we will need to use while\n  ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n  ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n  while ride_number &lt; 1 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n      print(\"There is no ride with that number\")\n      ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n      ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n  print(\"You have selected ride number: \", ride_number)\n\nwhile means program repeats until it receives valid input\nObserve the downside\n\nWe have to repeat the code asking for the ride number and converting to an integer\nSome languages have a do ... while statement which performs its test after executing the loop body for the first time\n\nWould allow us to write the above as one construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd ride number validation to the Looping Ride Selector implementation. Remember that the while construction must be added after the ride_number value has been read by the program\nWe can basically add the validation in immediately after the first attempt to read the ride number from the user. We also have to adjust the code to now use \\(0\\) as the explicit value for quitting rather than inferring any non-ride-number as a quit value. The main changes are,\nwhile run_program:\n    print(\"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n        These are the available ride:\n\n        1. Scenic River Cruise\n        2. Carnival Carousel\n        3. Jungle Adventure Water Splash\n        4. Downhill Mountain Run\n        5. The Regurgitator\n        Press 0 to quit the program\n        \"\"\")\n\n    ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n    ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n    while ride_number &lt; 0 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n        print(\"There is no ride with that number\")\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n    if ride_number == 0:\n        run_program = False\nThe complete code is given in RideNumberValidation.py\n\n\n\nWhen creating composite conditions for loops, making sure the logic is correct is incredibly important. Examine the following program to understand more complicated loop control\nage_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\nage = int(age_text)\nwhile age &lt; 1 and age &gt; 95:\n    #repeat this code while the age is invalid\n    print(\"This age is not valid\")\n    age_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    age = int(age_text)\n#when we are here, we have a valid age value\nprint(\"Thank you for entering your age\")\n\nWhat is the fault in this program?\n\nThe condition age &lt; 1 and age &gt; 95 requires age to be both less than \\(1\\) and greater than \\(95\\), this is impossible, so the loop never runs\n\nWhat will the fault cause the program to do?\n\nSince the loop body can never run, every entered age will be considered valid\n\nHow do you fix this?\n\nThe desired logic is that age should be between \\(1\\) and \\(95\\) inclusive. This logic is captured by the or operator. The corrected expression is\n  while age &lt; 1 or age &gt; 95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAlways test failure behaviours along with successful ones\nIt’s very important when testing software to test both the successful path (the so-called “happy path”) and any possible error states.\nA good programmer proactively looks for potential points of failure, writes code to handle the errors and importantly checks that the code to handle the errors does what it’s supposed to do\nA good heuristic for starting to do this with simple programs is called boundary-value testing. Boundaries are the points between different expected behaviours. For example with the ride selector, we expect different behaviour for numbers \\(&lt; 1\\) or \\(&gt; 5\\) to those in the range \\(1\\) to \\(5\\). So a good set of tests might be \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(5\\), \\(6\\). i.e. we test either side of the boundary, and on the boundary\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd age validation to the Ride Selection Program. The theme park owner has told you that the minimum age for anyone going on a ride at the theme park is \\(1\\) year, and the maximum age is \\(95\\). Use these values in your program\nObserve that in this case if the user provides an age outside the accepted range, we don’t want to prompt them to put in a new age, since this could legitimately be their age. Instead we want to tell them regardless of the ride they chose they can’t ride. In this case we should use an if style validation technique\nThe change is applied at our age reading section of the program, we use an if...elif...else construct to tell the user they are either too young, too old, or to continue on to the standard ride selection code\nage_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\nage = int(age_text)\nif age &lt;

Look at the example code below, (see HandlingInvalidText.py) and answer the questions\n# Example 6.4: Handling Invalid Text\n#\n# Combines loops and exception handling to prompt a user\n# for a valid number and repeat until a number is provided\n\nride_number_valid = False  # create and set a flag to False\nwhile not ride_number_valid:  # repeats while flag is False\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)  # can throw a ValueError\n        ride_number_valid = True  # successfully read a number\n    except ValueError:  # catch the ValueError\n        print(\"Invalid number. Please enter a number in digits\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)\n\nWhat is the purpose of the variable, ride_number_valid?\n\nIt is a flag\nTracks the state of a program, in this case a valid number been read\nStarts False once successfully received an int flips to True\n\nHow many times would you expect the while construction to loop when the program is used?\n\nIdeally we would expect it to run once\n\ni.e. The user enters a number straight away\n\nIn the next best case we would expect it run twice\n\nThe user experiences an error, reads the message and corrects their input the next time\n\n\nWhy don’t we have to test ride_number_valid at line \\(10\\), to make sure that the ride number is valid?\n\nThe while loop stops when it’s condition is False\nThis corresponds to ride_number_valid = True\nSo we know that once we leave the loop ride_number_valid must be True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes there a multiple exception types we wish to handle\ne.g. a KeyboardInterrupt allows a user to issue an exception which could stop a program\n\nIf the user is interacting with somebody else’s external facing program, we might not want them to be able to do this\n\nSimultaneously we might need to ensure that the user inputs valid data like numbers\nWe can just add an additional except block\n\nWhen an exception is thrown, the appropriate handler takes control\n\nThe improved exception handling code is given in HandlingInvalidTextMultipleExceptions\n\n# Example 6.5: Improved Handling Invalid Text\n#\n# Extends Example 6.4 by preventing the user from issuing a\n# keyboard interrupt to stop the program\n\nride_number_valid = False  # create and set a flag to False\nwhile not ride_number_valid:  # repeats while flag is False\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)  # can throw a ValueError\n        ride_number_valid = True  # successfully read a number\n    except ValueError:  # catch the ValueError\n        print(\"Invalid number. Please enter a number in digits\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:  # catches the interrupt\n        print(\"You do not have permission to interupt this program\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)  # type: ignore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlan for Failure\nWhen writing a program you should always be thinking about how it could fail and the appropriate response. Any point that asks for user input is a major potential point of failure and should be handled correctly.\nYou should never catch exceptions to hide errors. You could all statements in a try...except block, but then you can’t identify any errors that occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreak statements allow you to exit a loop from inside\nAs soon as a break is encountered control immediately jumps to the next statement after the loop\nThe example code is given in UsingBreakToExitLoops.py\n\n# Example 6.6 Using Break to Exit Loops\n#\n# Demonstrates using a break statement to exit\n# a while loop from inside the loop\n\nwhile True:  # use break rather than a condition to exit\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n        break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid number text. Please enter digits\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"You do not have permission to interupt this program\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)  # type: ignore\n\nThe above follows the previous example, but uses break rather than a flag to control the loop\nbreak statements can be paired with conditionals like if, as demonstrated in EarlyExitLoop.py\n\n\n# Example 6.7 Loop with condition ending early\n#\n# Demonstrates the pairing of break and conditional\n# statements to end a program early\n\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(\"Inside Loop\")\n    count = count + 1\n    if count == 3:\n        break\nprint(\"Outside loop\")\n\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nOutside loop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t use too many break statements\nA loop can theoretically only use many break statements to control flow. However break statements make it harder to reason about the flow of a loop. Sometimes they are the cleanest way to do something, but often they just make the code less readable.\nIn general prefer to use conditions to control loops, they are easier to reason about the state at the end of the loop\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinue causes control to immediately jump to the start of the next loop iteration\nFor example consider the Ride Selector example. If a ride is temporarily down we might push a patch to skip any selection of the ride, e.g. IgnoreRide.py given below\n\nwhile True:\n    ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n    ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n    if ride_number == 3:\n        print(\"sorry, this ride is unavailable\")\n        continue\n    print(\"you have selected ride number: \", ride_number)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou wont use continue as often as you use break\nbreak can be useful in quite a few use cases. continue tends to be much more niche and isn’t used often\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a variable to make a loop repeat a specified number of times, e.g. in the below Times Tables Program\n\n\n# Example 6.9 Times Tables Tutor\n#\n# Uses Times Tables to demonstrate use of a counter\n# variable to control a loop\n\ncount = 1\ntimes_value = 2\nwhile count &lt; 13:\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n    count = count + 1\n\n1 times 2 equals 2\n2 times 2 equals 4\n3 times 2 equals 6\n4 times 2 equals 8\n5 times 2 equals 10\n6 times 2 equals 12\n7 times 2 equals 14\n8 times 2 equals 16\n9 times 2 equals 18\n10 times 2 equals 20\n11 times 2 equals 22\n12 times 2 equals 24\n\n\n\nThe combination of while count &lt; 13 and count = count + 1 means that after \\(12\\) loop iterations the loop condition evaluates False and the loop ends\n\n\n\n\nConsider the previous example and answer the following questions\n\n\nWhat statement would you change if you wanted to generate the times table for three instead of two?\n\nWe would change times_value\n\nWhich statement would you change if you wanted to generate up to the \\(24\\) times table?\n\nWe would change the loop condition to count &lt; 25\n\nWhat would happen to the program if we changed the line count = count + 1 to count = count - 1\n\nThe loop would produce negative times tables, and never stop since count will be decreased every iteration and thus is always less than \\(13\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a version of the previous example that asks the user for the value of the times table they want. Add validation so that the user must enter a number between \\(2\\) and \\(12\\) inclusive\n\nOur solution (given in UserSelectedTimesTableTutor.py) prompts the user to enter a number between \\(2\\) - \\(12\\) inclusive, and then validates that the input is in the range. A try, except block is used to catch any invalid input type, and the whole thing is wrapped in a while True block that only ends once a valid integer in the range \\(2\\) - \\(12\\) is received through the use of a break statement.\nThe actual times tables code is then identical\n\n# Exercise 6.5 User SelectedTimes Tables Tutor\n#\n# Version of the times table tutor that allows the user to select the\n# times table in the range 2 - 12 they are interested in\n\ncount = 1\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        times_value_text = input(\n            \"Please enter a times table between 2-12 (inclusive): \"\n        )\n        times_value = int(times_value_text)\n        if times_value &lt; 2 or times_value &gt; 12:\n            print(\"Sorry, that is not between 2-12 (inclusive)\")\n        else:\n            break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter an integer\")\n\nwhile count &lt; 13:\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n    count = count + 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFor loops operate similar to while loops, but are designed for when the number of iterations are known\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 6\n    space\n    space\n    title[\"Breakdown of a For\"]:2\n    space\n    space\n\n    block:Input\n    columns 1\n        while[\"for\"]\n        whileDescr[\"(start of the for construction)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:MiddleOne\n    columns 1\n        condition[\"variable\"]\n        conditionName[\"function name\"]\n        conditionDescr[\"(variable controlled in the for)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:In\n    columns 1\n        in[\"in\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Items\n    columns 1\n        items[\"items\"]\n        itemsDescr[\"(items to work through)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:MiddleTwo\n    columns 1\n        colon[\":\"]\n        colonDescr[\"Colon\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Suite\n    columns 1\n        suite[\"Statement block\"]\n        suiteDescr[\"(statements)\"]\n    end\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass condition BG\nclass conditionName BG\nclass conditionDescr BG\nclass colon BG\nclass colonDescr BG\nclass while BG\nclass whileDescr BG\nclass items BG\nclass itemsDescr BG\nclass suite BG\nclass suiteDescr BG\nclass in BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor loops over a collection of items, acting on each item in turn\nEach iteration acts on next item in the collection\nAn example of a collection is a tuple, e.g.\n\nnames = ('Rob', 'Mary', 'David', 'Jenny', 'Chris', 'Imogen')\nnames is a tuple (denoted by the () containing the above names)\nWe’ll discuss Tuples in more detail in Chapter 8\n\nWe can pair the above tuple with a for loop e.g.\n\n\n# Example 6.10 Name Printer\n#\n# Prints a collection of names\nnames = ('Rob', 'Mary', 'David', 'Jenny', 'Chris', 'Imogen')\nfor name in names:\n    print(name)\n\nRob\nMary\nDavid\nJenny\nChris\nImogen\n\n\n\nrange is a python function for generating a collection of numbers\n\nsyntax is range(start, stop) where start is included, but stop is excluded\ne.g. We could rewrite ours times table program as using range (see [RangeBasedTimeTables.py])\n\n\n\n# Example 6.11 Range Based Times Tables\n#\n# Demonstrates Python's range function using a for\n# loop to generate a times table\n\ntimes_value = 2\nfor count in range(1, 13):\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n\n1 times 2 equals 2\n2 times 2 equals 4\n3 times 2 equals 6\n4 times 2 equals 8\n5 times 2 equals 10\n6 times 2 equals 12\n7 times 2 equals 14\n8 times 2 equals 16\n9 times 2 equals 18\n10 times 2 equals 20\n11 times 2 equals 22\n12 times 2 equals 24\n\n\n\nbreak and continue also work with for loops\n\ncontinue causes the loop to proceed to the next item in the collection\n\n\n\n\nLook at the following simple programs, and answer the corresponding questions about break and continue\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     if count == 5:\n         break\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFinished\n\n\n\nIt would print 1, 2, 3, 4 then \"finished\" since when count is \\(5\\) the loop breaks before the print statement and then the print outside the loop is called\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     if count == 5:\n         continue\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nFinished\n\n\n\nThis program is similar to the above, except it would print 1 through to 12 but skip 5, before printing \"Finished\". This is because the continue causes the loop iteration for count = 5 to skip the print statement in the loop and go to the next loop iteration\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     count = 13\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\nFinished\n\n\n\nThis will print \\(13\\) twelve times, because each time count starts a loop iteration it is set to the next value in the range(1, 13)\n\nThen inside the loop count is set to 13 and that value is printed\n\nOf course \"Finished\" is printed after the loop is down\n\nWould the following program run forever?\n\n while True:\n     break\n print('Finished')\n\nFinished\n\n\n\nNo, it will immediately end because break exits the loop\n\nWould the following program print the message “Looping”?\n while True:\n     continue\n     print('Looping')\n\nNo, the loop will hit the continue keyword and the go back to the start\nThis happens forever\n\nWhat would the following program do?

You could use a loop to make the program produce \\(12\\) “times-table” questions, and you could use random numbers so that the quiz is different every time\nOur solution given in TimesTableQuiz.py is relatively complete. We use first print a header message, then we set up a variable to track the number of correct answers total and a second variable to track the number of questions to ask. We then go into our for loop, looping over range(0, NumberOfQuestions), this makes the loop run NumberOfQuestions times.\nThe actual quiz then proceeds, we randomly generate the two numbers, the times_value from the range [2, 12] and the count from the range [1, 12]. We then calculate the correct answer, and prompt the user for an answer, using the standard ValueError exception handling. If the user’s answer is correct we congratulate them and increment the score, else we tell them what the correct answer is. After they’ve answered all the questions we give them the final score\n# Exercise 6.6: Times Table Quiz\n#\n# Generates a times table quiz\n\nimport random\n\nprint(\"===Times table Quiz===\")\nscore = 0\nNumberOfQuestions = 12\n\nfor question in range(0, NumberOfQuestions):\n    times_value = random.randint(2, 12)\n    count = random.randint(1, 12)\n    correct_answer = times_value * count\n    while True:\n        try:\n            answer_text = input(\n                \"What is \" + str(count) + \" x \" + str(times_value) + \": \"\n            )\n            answer = int(answer_text)\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter an integer\")\n    if answer == correct_answer:\n        score = score + 1\n        print(\"Corect!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry that's wrong!\")\n        print(\"The correct answer is\", correct_answer, \"you gave\", answer)\n\nprint(\"You got\", score, \"/\", NumberOfQuestions, \"correct\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting together what we’ve covered, we can make a digital clock using snaps (see DigitalClock.py)\n\n# Example 6.12: Digital Clock\n#\n# Uses a combination of loops and snaps to create a digital clock\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nwhile True:\n    current_time = time.localtime()\n    hour_string = str(current_time.tm_hour)\n    minute_string = str(current_time.tm_min)\n    second_string = str(current_time.tm_sec)\n\n    time_string = hour_string + \":\" + minute_string + \":\" + second_string\n    snaps.display_message(time_string)\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\nCombine the digital clock display from the previous example with the alarm clock from Chapter 5. Make the background image depend on the time of day\nOur final program is a bit complicated so we’ll analyse it in parts. The full file can be read in DigitalAlarmClock.py\nWe start by extracting the relevant date and time information from the current time, and perform a boolean check if it’s a weekend.\nWe first then check if the time is night (defined heuristically as from \\(7\\) pm through to \\(6\\) am) or day (\\(6\\) am to \\(7\\) pm). We then display a moon as the background in the former case, or a sun in the later.\nRemember we have to display the image first so that we can overlay the text on top.\n# Exercise 6.7: Digital Alarm Clock\n#\n# Integrates the Alarm Clock Functionality of\n# Chapter 5, with the Digital Clock Display of Chapter 6\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nwhile True:\n    current_time = time.localtime()\n\n    hour = current_time.tm_hour\n    minute = current_time.tm_min\n    second = current_time.tm_sec\n    day = current_time.tm_mday\n    month = current_time.tm_mon\n    year = current_time.tm_year\n    is_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5\n\n    # draw the background\n    # define day as 6am - 7pm\n    if hour &gt;= 6 and hour &lt;= 19:\n        snaps.display_image(\"sun.png\")\n    else:\n        snaps.display_image(\"moon.png\")\nNow we prepare our datetime strings\n    # set up normal time and day clock behaviour\n    date_message = \"The date is \" + str(day) + \"/\" + str(month) + \"/\" + str(year)\n    time_message = \"The time is \" + str(hour) + \":\" + str(minute) + \":\" + str(second)\n    message = date_message + \"\\n\" + time_message\nNext we want to play a wake alarm at \\(7:30\\) giving as extra hour to sleep in on weekends. We also want to define a bed time. When the time hits \\(7:30\\) we want to play the alarm, then before bed time (\\(22:00\\))the clock should display a message telling us to get up, while after bed time it should tell us to go to sleep.\nThe if...else construct here is a bit more complicated. We only want to play the alarm sound at \\(7:30:00\\) rather than just if the user runs the clock after the wakeup time. This is because the clock will then continuously play the sound every second it updates!\nOur first if statement thus checks if we are exactly on the alarm time, and if we are plays the alarm sound and updates the message\nWe then have to consider now when we check if the time is after the alarm has gone off that it is also not before it is time to go back to bed. It’s cleaner to split this into two cases (our elif statements)\nIn the first case if the hour is equal to the hour to get up and greater than the minute to get up then it must be time to get up and we don’t need to play the alarm (since the first if statement catches this case). Note this makes the assumption that we don’t wake up at a time like \\(8:30\\) and then go to bed at \\(8:59\\) which is reasonable.\nThe second case is when the hour is greater than the hour to get up. Here we have to check that either the hour is less than the hour we go to bed at or if it is the same, that the minutes are less than the minutes we go to bed at. (Effectively the reverse of our old alarm condition.) In either of the previous cases we only then need to update the final printed message with the statement that we should be up\nThe last case (the else) is our default case for when none of the previous cases are matched. By exhaustion of cases this has to be when it is time for us to be in bed by default. So we don’t need to do extra checks and can just update the message to tell us to go to sleep\n    # Play alarm and optionally append a wakeup message\n    hour_to_get_up = 7 + is_weekend\n    hour_to_sleep = 22\n    minute_to_get_up = 30\n    minute_to_sleep = 0\n\n    wake_up_message = \"TIME TO GET UP!\"\n    sleep_message = \"TIME FOR BED!\"\n\n    # case 1: On the alarm\n    if hour == hour_to_get_up and minute == minute_to_get_up and second == 0:\n        snaps.play_sound(\"siren.wav\")\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # Past the alarm\n    elif hour == hour_to_get_up and minute &gt;= minute_to_get_up:\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # past the alarm but before bed\n    elif hour &gt; hour_to_get_up and (\n        hour &lt; hour_to_sleep or (hour == hour_to_sleep and minute &lt; minute_to_sleep)\n    ):\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # time for bed\n    else:\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + sleep_message\nFinally we display the message and then sleep for a second before updating the clock again\n    # display the message and then sleep\n    snaps.display_message(message, size=100)\n    time.sleep(1)",

How about \"Outside loop\"?\n\n while False:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nOutside Loop\n\n\n\nThe while never executes the statements inside so \"Inside Loop\" is never printed, but \"Outside Loop\" is.\n\nWhat will the following program print?\n\n flag = True\n while flag:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n     flag = False\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nInside Loop\nOutside Loop\n\n\n\nWhen we first enter the loop flag is True so the loop executes and \"Inside Loop\" is printed, flag is then set False so on the next iteration of the loop, the loop doesn’t execute. We move to the next statement outside of the loop and print out \"Outside Loop\"\nThe pattern of using a control variable that is updated in the loop body in a while loop is very common\n\nWhat will the following program print?\n flag = True\n while flag:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n     Flag = False\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nThis looks similar to the previous, but note the typo, we refer to Flag not flag inside the loop, which defines a new variable, instead of modifying the loop control. We thus get an infinite series of \"Inside Loop\" being printed.\n\nWhat will the following program print?\n\n count = 0\n while count &lt; 5:\n     print(\"Inside Loop\")\n     count = count + 1\n print(\"Outside Loop\")\n\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nOutside Loop\n\n\n\ncount is initially set to \\(0\\), at each iteration we print \"Inside Loop\" and increase the value of count by \\(1\\). The loop stops once count reaches \\(5\\) This means that \"Inside Loop\" should be printed \\(5\\) times, followed by \"Outside Loop\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a while loop, to make a theme park selector that runs continously. All you need to do is put all of the statements that implement the theme park behaviour into a while True construction\nFor usability our program won’t loop endlessly. We’ll say that any number that it is not a valid ride number is code for quitting the program. The relevant changes to the Ride Selector are then,\nrun_program = True\n\nwhile run_program:\n    print(\"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n        These are the available ride:\n\n        1. Scenic River Cruise\n        2. Carnival Carousel\n        3. Jungle Adventure Water Splash\n        4. Downhill Mountain Run\n        5. The Regurgitator\n        Any other number to quit...\n        \"\"\")\n\n    ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n    ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n    if ride_number &lt; 1 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n        run_program = False\n    elif ride_number == 1:\nObserve that first we wrap all of the code in a while loop, and introduce a boolean flag run_program initially set to True to flag if the program continues to run at each loop iteration. When a user enters a number we first check if it corresponds to a ride number and if not, we set the program to quit on the next loop iteration by setting run_program to False. We now change the original if ride_number == 1 to and elif so it is only checked if we know the ride_number is valid. (The full code is in LoopingRideSelector.py)\n\n\n\nOne of the examples in the above question set involved a countup to \\(5\\). Implement a program that counts down from \\(10\\) to \\(0\\) over \\(10\\) seconds\n# Exercise 6.2: Countdown\n# Performs a 10-second countdown\n\nimport time\n\ntime_left = 10\n\nwhile time_left &gt;= 0:\n    print(time_left)\n    time_left = time_left - 1\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nThis is a straightforward exercise (see Countdown.py), we set up our counter value to \\(10\\) and use the appropriate loop expression (here time_left &gt;= 0) to ensure that \\(0\\) is included in the countdown.\nIn the loop we print the current value of time_left, then decrement time_left by \\(1\\), and sleep for the required time. Observe that after the program prints \\(0\\), time_left becomes \\(-1\\) and the next iteration of the loop won’t run.\n\n\n\n\nRide Selector doesn’t account for invalid user entry\n\nBlindly assumes a number outside the range \\(1\\) to \\(5\\) represents quitting the program\n\nIdeally we would like to have a distinct number that represents quitting and a way to capture and handle any invalid inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGreat Programmers Think Defensively\nDefensive programming is a programming technique in which a programmer attempts to defend their code against possible errors that might occur in a code e.g. receiving a word when expecting a number\nIt is good practice to think about, typically a user expects a computer to do something reasonable even when provided unreasonable input.\nData validation does have the downside in that it can make programs significantly bigger, and in compiled languages knowing that data is valid can make them much faster. A good skill is learning the correct layers or boundaries of a program to perform the defensive data validation so the core can run without concern\n\n\n\nIgnoring the question of quitting for now, data validation for the ride selector might look like,\n  if ride_number &lt; 1 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n      print('Invalid ride number')\n\n\n\n\nAbove acknowledges the error, but if we want to use this in our loop control we will need to use while\n  ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n  ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n  while ride_number &lt; 1 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n      print(\"There is no ride with that number\")\n      ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n      ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n  print(\"You have selected ride number: \", ride_number)\n\nwhile means program repeats until it receives valid input\nObserve the downside\n\nWe have to repeat the code asking for the ride number and converting to an integer\nSome languages have a do ... while statement which performs its test after executing the loop body for the first time\n\nWould allow us to write the above as one construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd ride number validation to the Looping Ride Selector implementation. Remember that the while construction must be added after the ride_number value has been read by the program\nWe can basically add the validation in immediately after the first attempt to read the ride number from the user. We also have to adjust the code to now use \\(0\\) as the explicit value for quitting rather than inferring any non-ride-number as a quit value. The main changes are,\nwhile run_program:\n    print(\"\"\"Welcome to our Theme Park\n        These are the available ride:\n\n        1. Scenic River Cruise\n        2. Carnival Carousel\n        3. Jungle Adventure Water Splash\n        4. Downhill Mountain Run\n        5. The Regurgitator\n        Press 0 to quit the program\n        \"\"\")\n\n    ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n    ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n    while ride_number &lt; 0 or ride_number &gt; 5:\n        print(\"There is no ride with that number\")\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n    if ride_number == 0:\n        run_program = False\nThe complete code is given in RideNumberValidation.py\n\n\n\nWhen creating composite conditions for loops, making sure the logic is correct is incredibly important. Examine the following program to understand more complicated loop control\nage_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\nage = int(age_text)\nwhile age &lt; 1 and age &gt; 95:\n    #repeat this code while the age is invalid\n    print(\"This age is not valid\")\n    age_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\n    age = int(age_text)\n#when we are here, we have a valid age value\nprint(\"Thank you for entering your age\")\n\nWhat is the fault in this program?\n\nThe condition age &lt; 1 and age &gt; 95 requires age to be both less than \\(1\\) and greater than \\(95\\), this is impossible, so the loop never runs\n\nWhat will the fault cause the program to do?\n\nSince the loop body can never run, every entered age will be considered valid\n\nHow do you fix this?\n\nThe desired logic is that age should be between \\(1\\) and \\(95\\) inclusive. This logic is captured by the or operator. The corrected expression is\n  while age &lt; 1 or age &gt; 95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAlways test failure behaviours along with successful ones\nIt’s very important when testing software to test both the successful path (the so-called “happy path”) and any possible error states.\nA good programmer proactively looks for potential points of failure, writes code to handle the errors and importantly checks that the code to handle the errors does what it’s supposed to do\nA good heuristic for starting to do this with simple programs is called boundary-value testing. Boundaries are the points between different expected behaviours. For example with the ride selector, we expect different behaviour for numbers \\(&lt; 1\\) or \\(&gt; 5\\) to those in the range \\(1\\) to \\(5\\). So a good set of tests might be \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(5\\), \\(6\\). i.e. we test either side of the boundary, and on the boundary\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd age validation to the Ride Selection Program. The theme park owner has told you that the minimum age for anyone going on a ride at the theme park is \\(1\\) year, and the maximum age is \\(95\\). Use these values in your program\nObserve that in this case if the user provides an age outside the accepted range, we don’t want to prompt them to put in a new age, since this could legitimately be their age. Instead we want to tell them regardless of the ride they chose they can’t ride. In this case we should use an if style validation technique\nThe change is applied at our age reading section of the program, we use an if...elif...else construct to tell the user they are either too young, too old, or to continue on to the standard ride selection code\nage_text = input(\"Please enter your age: \")\nage = int(age_text)\nif age &lt; 1:\n    print(\"You are too young to go on any rides\")\nelif age &gt; 95:\n    print(\"You are too old to go on any rides\")\nelse:\n    #continue on to normal ride selection code...\nThe full code is given in AgeValidation.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: We can easily write a loop that checks if a value is invalid but how do we deal with the type being invalid?\n\ne.g. in the ride selector how do we deal with the user typing in a word rather than a number?\nConsider the snippet below, emulating the ride selector given a string input, we get an error, before we even get a chance to validate the value\n\n\n  ride_number_text = \"three\"\n  ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[6], line 2\n      1 ride_number_text = \"three\"\n----&gt; 2 ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'three'\n\n\n\n\nThis occurs because int requires it’s input to be convertable to a number\n\nUnfortunately this does not extend to human-language written versions of a number\nIn this case int throws an error, it is better to end the program than continue in an erroneous state\n\nIn general, when a program encounters an error state, it should aim to fail fast, rather than continue and generate unexpected outcomes\n\nExceptions are a mechanism by which elements of a program can inform other parts about errors that have occured\n\nExceptions combine a description of what the error that occured was, with where the error occured\nIn the example above e.g. we are told that we got a ValueError\ni.e. an invalid value was found, we are given the additional detail “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘three’”\nIn plain english, the program did not know how to convert ‘three’ to an integer\nWe are also told where, in this case the second line, in the function int\n\nTo recover from an exception we have to handle it, i.e. do something\n\nThe first step is to catch the exception\nWe wrap code that might throw an exception in a try... except block\n\n# Example 6.3: Catching Exceptions\n#\n# Demonstrates how to catch and handle\n# an exception\n\n  try:\n      ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter a ride number: \")\n      ride_number = int(ride_number_text) #statement that might raise exception\n      print(\"You have entered\", ride_number)\n  except ValueError: # Start of an exception handler\n      print(\"Invalid number\") # Performed if exception raised\nWe wrap the code that may throw an exception in a try\nWe then use except to define statements we want to run if an exception is thrown\n\nIf an exception is thrown, control immediately jumps to the except block\ne.g. In the above example if int throws a ValueError then the line print(\"You have entered\", ride_number) won’t run\n\nInstead print(\"Invalid number\") runs\n\n\nAs observed except is followed by the exception type we want to catch (in this case ValueError)\nThe full example is given in CatchingExceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 4\n    space\n    title[\"Breakdown of a Try-Except Block\"]:2\n    space\n\n    block:Try:2\n    columns 1\n        try[\"try\"]\n        tryDescr[\"(start of the try construction)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:TryColon\n    columns 1\n        Trycolon[\":\"]\n        TryColonDescr[\"colon\"]\n    end\n\n    block:TrySuite\n    columns 1\n        Trysuite[\"Statements\"]\n        TrysuiteDescr[(\"statements to execute normally\")]\n    end\n\n\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass try BG\nclass tryDescr BG\nclass Trycolon BG\nclass TryColonDescr BG\nclass Trysuite BG\nclass TrysuiteDescr BG\n\n    block:ExceptOne\n    columns 1\n        exceptOne[\"except\"]\n        exceptOneDescr[\"(start of an exception construction)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptNameOne\n    columns 1\n        exceptOneName[\"Name\"]\n        exceptOneNameDescr[\"(exception name)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptOneColon\n    columns 1\n        exceptOneColon[\":\"]\n        exceptOneColonDescr[\"colon\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptOneStatements\n    columns 1\n        exceptOneStatements[\"statements\"]\n        exceptOneStatementsDescr[(\"statements to execute if exception caught\")]\n    end\n\nclass exceptOne BG\nclass exceptOneDescr BG\nclass exceptOneName BG\nclass exceptOneNameDescr BG\nclass exceptOneColon BG\nclass exceptOneColonDescr BG\nclass exceptOneStatements BG\nclass exceptOneStatementsDescr BG\n\n    block:ExceptTwo\n    columns 1\n        exceptTwo[\"except\"]\n        exceptTwoDescr[\"(start of an exception construction)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptNameTwo\n    columns 1\n        exceptTwoName[\"Name\"]\n        exceptTwoNameDescr[\"(exception name)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptTwoColon\n    columns 1\n        exceptTwoColon[\":\"]\n        exceptTwoColonDescr[\"colon\"]\n    end\n\n    block:ExceptTwoStatements\n    columns 1\n        exceptTwoStatements[\"statements\"]\n        exceptTwoStatementsDescr[(\"statements to execute if exception caught\")]\n    end\n\nclass exceptTwo BG\nclass exceptTwoDescr BG\nclass exceptTwoName BG\nclass exceptTwoNameDescr BG\nclass exceptTwoColon BG\nclass exceptTwoColonDescr BG\nclass exceptTwoStatements BG\nclass exceptTwoStatementsDescr BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated above a try...except block may contain multiple except statements designed to handle different exception types\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen how to use loops to handle invalid values\nWe’ve seen how to use exceptions to handle invalid types\nNow let’s put that together to write a loop to handle exceptions\n\n\n\nWe want to make a program that will perform a while construction as long as the user keeps typing in text that cannot be converted into a number. Look at the example code below, (see HandlingInvalidText.py) and answer the questions\n# Example 6.4: Handling Invalid Text\n#\n# Combines loops and exception handling to prompt a user\n# for a valid number and repeat until a number is provided\n\nride_number_valid = False  # create and set a flag to False\nwhile not ride_number_valid:  # repeats while flag is False\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)  # can throw a ValueError\n        ride_number_valid = True  # successfully read a number\n    except ValueError:  # catch the ValueError\n        print(\"Invalid number. Please enter a number in digits\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)\n\nWhat is the purpose of the variable, ride_number_valid?\n\nIt is a flag\nTracks the state of a program, in this case a valid number been read\nStarts False once successfully received an int flips to True\n\nHow many times would you expect the while construction to loop when the program is used?\n\nIdeally we would expect it to run once\n\ni.e. The user enters a number straight away\n\nIn the next best case we would expect it run twice\n\nThe user experiences an error, reads the message and corrects their input the next time\n\n\nWhy don’t we have to test ride_number_valid at line \\(10\\), to make sure that the ride number is valid?\n\nThe while loop stops when it’s condition is False\nThis corresponds to ride_number_valid = True\nSo we know that once we leave the loop ride_number_valid must be True\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes there a multiple exception types we wish to handle\ne.g. a KeyboardInterrupt allows a user to issue an exception which could stop a program\n\nIf the user is interacting with somebody else’s external facing program, we might not want them to be able to do this\n\nSimultaneously we might need to ensure that the user inputs valid data like numbers\nWe can just add an additional except block\n\nWhen an exception is thrown, the appropriate handler takes control\n\nThe improved exception handling code is given in HandlingInvalidTextMultipleExceptions\n\n# Example 6.5: Improved Handling Invalid Text\n#\n# Extends Example 6.4 by preventing the user from issuing a\n# keyboard interrupt to stop the program\n\nride_number_valid = False  # create and set a flag to False\nwhile not ride_number_valid:  # repeats while flag is False\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)  # can throw a ValueError\n        ride_number_valid = True  # successfully read a number\n    except ValueError:  # catch the ValueError\n        print(\"Invalid number. Please enter a number in digits\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:  # catches the interrupt\n        print(\"You do not have permission to interupt this program\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)  # type: ignore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlan for Failure\nWhen writing a program you should always be thinking about how it could fail and the appropriate response. Any point that asks for user input is a major potential point of failure and should be handled correctly.\nYou should never catch exceptions to hide errors. You could all statements in a try...except block, but then you can’t identify any errors that occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreak statements allow you to exit a loop from inside\nAs soon as a break is encountered control immediately jumps to the next statement after the loop\nThe example code is given in UsingBreakToExitLoops.py\n\n# Example 6.6 Using Break to Exit Loops\n#\n# Demonstrates using a break statement to exit\n# a while loop from inside the loop\n\nwhile True:  # use break rather than a condition to exit\n    try:\n        ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n        ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n        break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid number text. Please enter digits\")\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"You do not have permission to interupt this program\")\n# Once outside the loop we have a valid number\nprint(\"You have selected ride\", ride_number)  # type: ignore\n\nThe above follows the previous example, but uses break rather than a flag to control the loop\nbreak statements can be paired with conditionals like if, as demonstrated in EarlyExitLoop.py\n\n\n# Example 6.7 Loop with condition ending early\n#\n# Demonstrates the pairing of break and conditional\n# statements to end a program early\n\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(\"Inside Loop\")\n    count = count + 1\n    if count == 3:\n        break\nprint(\"Outside loop\")\n\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nInside Loop\nOutside loop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDon’t use too many break statements\nA loop can theoretically only use many break statements to control flow. However break statements make it harder to reason about the flow of a loop. Sometimes they are the cleanest way to do something, but often they just make the code less readable.\nIn general prefer to use conditions to control loops, they are easier to reason about the state at the end of the loop\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontinue causes control to immediately jump to the start of the next loop iteration\nFor example consider the Ride Selector example. If a ride is temporarily down we might push a patch to skip any selection of the ride, e.g. IgnoreRide.py given below\n\nwhile True:\n    ride_number_text = input(\"Please enter the ride number you want: \")\n    ride_number = int(ride_number_text)\n    if ride_number == 3:\n        print(\"sorry, this ride is unavailable\")\n        continue\n    print(\"you have selected ride number: \", ride_number)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou wont use continue as often as you use break\nbreak can be useful in quite a few use cases. continue tends to be much more niche and isn’t used often\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use a variable to make a loop repeat a specified number of times, e.g. in the below Times Tables Program\n\n\n# Example 6.9 Times Tables Tutor\n#\n# Uses Times Tables to demonstrate use of a counter\n# variable to control a loop\n\ncount = 1\ntimes_value = 2\nwhile count &lt; 13:\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n    count = count + 1\n\n1 times 2 equals 2\n2 times 2 equals 4\n3 times 2 equals 6\n4 times 2 equals 8\n5 times 2 equals 10\n6 times 2 equals 12\n7 times 2 equals 14\n8 times 2 equals 16\n9 times 2 equals 18\n10 times 2 equals 20\n11 times 2 equals 22\n12 times 2 equals 24\n\n\n\nThe combination of while count &lt; 13 and count = count + 1 means that after \\(12\\) loop iterations the loop condition evaluates False and the loop ends\n\n\n\n\nConsider the previous example and answer the following questions\n\n\nWhat statement would you change if you wanted to generate the times table for three instead of two?\n\nWe would change times_value\n\nWhich statement would you change if you wanted to generate up to the \\(24\\) times table?\n\nWe would change the loop condition to count &lt; 25\n\nWhat would happen to the program if we changed the line count = count + 1 to count = count - 1\n\nThe loop would produce negative times tables, and never stop since count will be decreased every iteration and thus is always less than \\(13\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a version of the previous example that asks the user for the value of the times table they want. Add validation so that the user must enter a number between \\(2\\) and \\(12\\) inclusive\n\nOur solution (given in UserSelectedTimesTableTutor.py) prompts the user to enter a number between \\(2\\) - \\(12\\) inclusive, and then validates that the input is in the range. A try, except block is used to catch any invalid input type, and the whole thing is wrapped in a while True block that only ends once a valid integer in the range \\(2\\) - \\(12\\) is received through the use of a break statement.\nThe actual times tables code is then identical\n\n# Exercise 6.5 User SelectedTimes Tables Tutor\n#\n# Version of the times table tutor that allows the user to select the\n# times table in the range 2 - 12 they are interested in\n\ncount = 1\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        times_value_text = input(\n            \"Please enter a times table between 2-12 (inclusive): \"\n        )\n        times_value = int(times_value_text)\n        if times_value &lt; 2 or times_value &gt; 12:\n            print(\"Sorry, that is not between 2-12 (inclusive)\")\n        else:\n            break\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter an integer\")\n\nwhile count &lt; 13:\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n    count = count + 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFor loops operate similar to while loops, but are designed for when the number of iterations are known\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock-beta\n    columns 6\n    space\n    space\n    title[\"Breakdown of a For\"]:2\n    space\n    space\n\n    block:Input\n    columns 1\n        while[\"for\"]\n        whileDescr[\"(start of the for construction)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:MiddleOne\n    columns 1\n        condition[\"variable\"]\n        conditionName[\"function name\"]\n        conditionDescr[\"(variable controlled in the for)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:In\n    columns 1\n        in[\"in\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Items\n    columns 1\n        items[\"items\"]\n        itemsDescr[\"(items to work through)\"]\n    end\n\n    block:MiddleTwo\n    columns 1\n        colon[\":\"]\n        colonDescr[\"Colon\"]\n    end\n\n    block:Suite\n    columns 1\n        suite[\"Statement block\"]\n        suiteDescr[\"(statements)\"]\n    end\n\nclassDef BG stroke:transparent, fill:transparent\nclass title BG\nclass condition BG\nclass conditionName BG\nclass conditionDescr BG\nclass colon BG\nclass colonDescr BG\nclass while BG\nclass whileDescr BG\nclass items BG\nclass itemsDescr BG\nclass suite BG\nclass suiteDescr BG\nclass in BG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor loops over a collection of items, acting on each item in turn\nEach iteration acts on next item in the collection\nAn example of a collection is a tuple, e.g.\n\nnames = ('Rob', 'Mary', 'David', 'Jenny', 'Chris', 'Imogen')\nnames is a tuple (denoted by the () containing the above names)\nWe’ll discuss Tuples in more detail in Chapter 8\n\nWe can pair the above tuple with a for loop e.g.\n\n\n# Example 6.10 Name Printer\n#\n# Prints a collection of names\nnames = ('Rob', 'Mary', 'David', 'Jenny', 'Chris', 'Imogen')\nfor name in names:\n    print(name)\n\nRob\nMary\nDavid\nJenny\nChris\nImogen\n\n\n\nrange is a python function for generating a collection of numbers\n\nsyntax is range(start, stop) where start is included, but stop is excluded\ne.g. We could rewrite ours times table program as using range (see [RangeBasedTimeTables.py])\n\n\n\n# Example 6.11 Range Based Times Tables\n#\n# Demonstrates Python's range function using a for\n# loop to generate a times table\n\ntimes_value = 2\nfor count in range(1, 13):\n    result = count * times_value\n    print(count, \"times\", times_value, \"equals\", result)\n\n1 times 2 equals 2\n2 times 2 equals 4\n3 times 2 equals 6\n4 times 2 equals 8\n5 times 2 equals 10\n6 times 2 equals 12\n7 times 2 equals 14\n8 times 2 equals 16\n9 times 2 equals 18\n10 times 2 equals 20\n11 times 2 equals 22\n12 times 2 equals 24\n\n\n\nbreak and continue also work with for loops\n\ncontinue causes the loop to proceed to the next item in the collection\n\n\n\n\nLook at the following simple programs, and answer the corresponding questions about break and continue\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     if count == 5:\n         break\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFinished\n\n\n\nIt would print 1, 2, 3, 4 then \"finished\" since when count is \\(5\\) the loop breaks before the print statement and then the print outside the loop is called\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     if count == 5:\n         continue\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nFinished\n\n\n\nThis program is similar to the above, except it would print 1 through to 12 but skip 5, before printing \"Finished\". This is because the continue causes the loop iteration for count = 5 to skip the print statement in the loop and go to the next loop iteration\n\nWhat would the following code print?\n\n for count in range(1, 13):\n     count = 13\n     print(count)\n print('Finished')\n\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\nFinished\n\n\n\nThis will print \\(13\\) twelve times, because each time count starts a loop iteration it is set to the next value in the range(1, 13)\n\nThen inside the loop count is set to 13 and that value is printed\n\nOf course \"Finished\" is printed after the loop is down\n\nWould the following program run forever?\n\n while True:\n     break\n print('Finished')\n\nFinished\n\n\n\nNo, it will immediately end because break exits the loop\n\nWould the following program print the message “Looping”?\n while True:\n     continue\n     print('Looping')\n\nNo, the loop will hit the continue keyword and the go back to the start\nThis happens forever\n\nWhat would the following program do? Is it legal?\n\n for letter in 'hello world':\n     print(letter)\n\nh\ne\nl\nl\no\n\nw\no\nr\nl\nd\n\n\n\nStrings are collections of letters\nThe above program works, it loops over and prints each letter in the string\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse the behaviour of the times-table program so that rather than printing out the times-table your program insteads asks questions like, “What is \\(6\\) times \\(4\\)?” The user could enter their answer, and the program could compare it with the correct answer and keep score of how many correct answers are given. You could use a loop to make the program produce \\(12\\) “times-table” questions, and you could use random numbers so that the quiz is different every time\nOur solution given in TimesTableQuiz.py is relatively complete. We use first print a header message, then we set up a variable to track the number of correct answers total and a second variable to track the number of questions to ask. We then go into our for loop, looping over range(0, NumberOfQuestions), this makes the loop run NumberOfQuestions times.\nThe actual quiz then proceeds, we randomly generate the two numbers, the times_value from the range [2, 12] and the count from the range [1, 12]. We then calculate the correct answer, and prompt the user for an answer, using the standard ValueError exception handling. If the user’s answer is correct we congratulate them and increment the score, else we tell them what the correct answer is. After they’ve answered all the questions we give them the final score\n# Exercise 6.6: Times Table Quiz\n#\n# Generates a times table quiz\n\nimport random\n\nprint(\"===Times table Quiz===\")\nscore = 0\nNumberOfQuestions = 12\n\nfor question in range(0, NumberOfQuestions):\n    times_value = random.randint(2, 12)\n    count = random.randint(1, 12)\n    correct_answer = times_value * count\n    while True:\n        try:\n            answer_text = input(\n                \"What is \" + str(count) + \" x \" + str(times_value) + \": \"\n            )\n            answer = int(answer_text)\n            break\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Please enter an integer\")\n    if answer == correct_answer:\n        score = score + 1\n        print(\"Corect!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sorry that's wrong!\")\n        print(\"The correct answer is\", correct_answer, \"you gave\", answer)\n\nprint(\"You got\", score, \"/\", NumberOfQuestions, \"correct\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting together what we’ve covered, we can make a digital clock using snaps (see DigitalClock.py)\n\n# Example 6.12: Digital Clock\n#\n# Uses a combination of loops and snaps to create a digital clock\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nwhile True:\n    current_time = time.localtime()\n    hour_string = str(current_time.tm_hour)\n    minute_string = str(current_time.tm_min)\n    second_string = str(current_time.tm_sec)\n\n    time_string = hour_string + \":\" + minute_string + \":\" + second_string\n    snaps.display_message(time_string)\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\nCombine the digital clock display from the previous example with the alarm clock from Chapter 5. Make the background image depend on the time of day\nOur final program is a bit complicated so we’ll analyse it in parts. The full file can be read in DigitalAlarmClock.py\nWe start by extracting the relevant date and time information from the current time, and perform a boolean check if it’s a weekend.\nWe first then check if the time is night (defined heuristically as from \\(7\\) pm through to \\(6\\) am) or day (\\(6\\) am to \\(7\\) pm). We then display a moon as the background in the former case, or a sun in the later.\nRemember we have to display the image first so that we can overlay the text on top.\n# Exercise 6.7: Digital Alarm Clock\n#\n# Integrates the Alarm Clock Functionality of\n# Chapter 5, with the Digital Clock Display of Chapter 6\n\nimport time\nimport snaps\n\nwhile True:\n    current_time = time.localtime()\n\n    hour = current_time.tm_hour\n    minute = current_time.tm_min\n    second = current_time.tm_sec\n    day = current_time.tm_mday\n    month = current_time.tm_mon\n    year = current_time.tm_year\n    is_weekend = current_time.tm_wday &gt;= 5\n\n    # draw the background\n    # define day as 6am - 7pm\n    if hour &gt;= 6 and hour &lt;= 19:\n        snaps.display_image(\"sun.png\")\n    else:\n        snaps.display_image(\"moon.png\")\nNow we prepare our datetime strings\n    # set up normal time and day clock behaviour\n    date_message = \"The date is \" + str(day) + \"/\" + str(month) + \"/\" + str(year)\n    time_message = \"The time is \" + str(hour) + \":\" + str(minute) + \":\" + str(second)\n    message = date_message + \"\\n\" + time_message\nNext we want to play a wake alarm at \\(7:30\\) giving as extra hour to sleep in on weekends. We also want to define a bed time. When the time hits \\(7:30\\) we want to play the alarm, then before bed time (\\(22:00\\))the clock should display a message telling us to get up, while after bed time it should tell us to go to sleep.\nThe if...else construct here is a bit more complicated. We only want to play the alarm sound at \\(7:30:00\\) rather than just if the user runs the clock after the wakeup time. This is because the clock will then continuously play the sound every second it updates!\nOur first if statement thus checks if we are exactly on the alarm time, and if we are plays the alarm sound and updates the message\nWe then have to consider now when we check if the time is after the alarm has gone off that it is also not before it is time to go back to bed. It’s cleaner to split this into two cases (our elif statements)\nIn the first case if the hour is equal to the hour to get up and greater than the minute to get up then it must be time to get up and we don’t need to play the alarm (since the first if statement catches this case). Note this makes the assumption that we don’t wake up at a time like \\(8:30\\) and then go to bed at \\(8:59\\) which is reasonable.\nThe second case is when the hour is greater than the hour to get up. Here we have to check that either the hour is less than the hour we go to bed at or if it is the same, that the minutes are less than the minutes we go to bed at. (Effectively the reverse of our old alarm condition.) In either of the previous cases we only then need to update the final printed message with the statement that we should be up\nThe last case (the else) is our default case for when none of the previous cases are matched. By exhaustion of cases this has to be when it is time for us to be in bed by default. So we don’t need to do extra checks and can just update the message to tell us to go to sleep\n    # Play alarm and optionally append a wakeup message\n    hour_to_get_up = 7 + is_weekend\n    hour_to_sleep = 22\n    minute_to_get_up = 30\n    minute_to_sleep = 0\n\n    wake_up_message = \"TIME TO GET UP!\"\n    sleep_message = \"TIME FOR BED!\"\n\n    # case 1: On the alarm\n    if hour == hour_to_get_up and minute == minute_to_get_up and second == 0:\n        snaps.play_sound(\"siren.wav\")\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # Past the alarm\n    elif hour == hour_to_get_up and minute &gt;= minute_to_get_up:\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # past the alarm but before bed\n    elif hour &gt; hour_to_get_up and (\n        hour &lt; hour_to_sleep or (hour == hour_to_sleep and minute &lt; minute_to_sleep)\n    ):\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + wake_up_message\n    # time for bed\n    else:\n        message = message + \"\\n\" + sleep_message\nFinally we display the message and then sleep for a second before updating the clock again\n    # display the message and then sleep\n    snaps.display_message(message, size=100)\n    time.sleep(1)",
