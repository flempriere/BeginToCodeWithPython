## Notes

### Advanced Functions

- Python functions are powerful and can be used in some interesting ways

#### References to Functions

- We've seen that we can use references to functions much like variables
- e.g. `map` in [Chapter 10](../10_UseClassesToCreateActiveObjects/Chapter_10.qmd#the-python-map-function) took a reference to a function and applied it element-wise to a list
    - Another example was [`filter`](../11_ObjectBasedSolutionDesign/Chapter_11.qmd#filter-on-tags)
- Let's explore this in more detail, consider the following code snippet (see [SimpleFunctionReferences.py](./Examples/01_SimpleFunctionReferences/SimpleFunctionReferences.py))

  ```{python}
    # Example 12.1 Simple Function References

    def func_1():
        print("Hello from function 1")

    def func_2():
        print("Hello from function 2")

    x = func_1
    x()
    x = func_2
    x()
  ```

- We have two functions `func_1` and `func_2`
- We can assign the variable `x` to refer to and call each of these in turn
    - The dereference operator `()` called on `x` resolves to the function it references
- The variable is effectively another name for the function
- We still have to call it properly, e.g. (see [InvalidFunctionReferences.py](./Examples/02_InvalidFunctionReferences/InvalidFunctionReferences.py))

  ```{python}
    # Example 12.2 Invalid Function References

    def func_1():
        print("Hello from func_1")

    x = func_1
    x(99)
  ```

- The above generates an error as expected, because `x` is given an argument `99`
- `func_1` takes no arguments
- The error resolves to the original function name (here `func_1`)
