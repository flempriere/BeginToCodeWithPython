## Notes

### Make a Tiny Contacts App

- Let's develop a lightweight program to store contact details
    1. Names
    2. Addresses
    3. Telephone Numbers

- We storyboard the interface

  ```text
    Tiny Contacts

    1. New Contact
    2. Find Contact
    3. Exit Program

    Enter your command:
  ```

- We then want to extend the storyboard to the different interface options

  ```text
    Create new contact

    Enter the contact name: Rob Miles
    Enter the contact address: 18 Pussycat Mews, London, NE1 410S
    Enter the contact phone: +44(1234) 56789

    Contact record stored for Rob Miles
  ```

- The matching storyboard for find is then,

  ```text
    Find Contact

    Enter the contact name: Rob Miles
    Name: Rob Miles
    Address: 18 Pussycat Mews, London, NE1 410S
    Phone: +44(1234) 56789
  ```

  - With a matching storyboard for a contact not existing

    ```text
        Find Contact

        Enter the contact name: Fred Bloggs
        This name was not found
    ```
