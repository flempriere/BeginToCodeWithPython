This repository contains code fragments, notes and exercises from the book Begin to Code With Python by Rob Miles. The book is available at the [official Microsoft Press Store](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/begin-to-code-with-python-9781509304523).

I started this repository to work through an easy and basic book before working on some more intermediate level python projects and books.

### Useful Python

::: {.callout-important}
  Chapter 1 only provides basic information on installing *python* and assumes a Windows environment so is not covered in these notes

## Python Version

The original book was written with *python 2.X* and *python 3.6* in mind. Currently we've written for *python 3.12* but may change this if compatibility issues arise.
