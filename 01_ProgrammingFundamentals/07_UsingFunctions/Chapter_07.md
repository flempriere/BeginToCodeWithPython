## Notes

### What makes a Function?

- A function is a named chunk of code
  - Can be thought of as like a variable containing code rather than a
    value
  - Consider the simple function

  ``` python
    def greeter():
        print("Hello")
  ```

  - Print’s the message `"Hello"`
  - Called by the function name, then parentheses, e.g.

  ``` python
    greeter()
  ```

      Hello

  - functions must be defined *before* they can be called \## Summary
