# Begin to Code with Python

This repository contains code fragments, notes and exercises from the book Begin to Code With Python by Rob Miles. I started this repository to work through an easy and basic book before working on some more intermediate level python projects and books.

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows,

1. [`samples`](./samples/)
    - A github submodule linking to the original code provided by the book's author Rob Miles
    - We mostly use this for the `snaps.py` "library" used in several cases
2. Part - A Collection of Chapters with similar themes
    1. Chapter - A specific Chapter
        1. `index.md` - A markdown file containing notes, and descriptions of examples and exercises
        2. `Examples` - A folder containing any examples from the book
        3. `Exercises` - A folder containing exercise code, often modified from the examples
